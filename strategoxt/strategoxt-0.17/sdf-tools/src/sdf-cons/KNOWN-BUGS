  + To make constructors unique, only the device of adding
    primes is used. It would be nicer if for non-unique
    constructors of different sorts the device of qualifying
    with the sort name would be used.

  + To ensure constructors to start with an uppercase letter,
    those that do not are qualified with the sort name. It would
    be nicer if the first letter was just cast to uppercase.

  + Verbalization of signs such as commas plusses etc now occurs
    at the phase where literals are extracted from productions. If
    this is done at the phase where symbols are verbalized only, then
    the resulting constructor names would probably be nicer.

  + There is no check for well-formedness of user-supplied 
    constructor names.

  + Productions in priority section get constructor names too.
    This may be not a bug by itself, but if the production occurs
    both in a priority section and in a syntax section, then syntactic
    differences (such as having attributes or not) lead to different
    constructor names. Thus, the equivalence check between productions, 
    which is now done by testing identity, should be weakened.
