2) In the C-Preprocessor module,

Some of the line info produced by the GCC preprocessor isn't recognized:

I think it suffices to replace the line

"#" WS Constant ( "\"" WS Filename WS "\"" )? WS [\n] -> ControlLine

by

"#" WS IntLiteral ( "\"" WS Filename WS "\"")? WS
( (IntLiteral WS IntLiteral) ? IntLiteral ) -> ControlLine

----------------------------------------------------------
3b) Related to (3a), the following program parses wrongly (and no 
ambiguities are reported):

int main()
{
   int z,v;
   return (z) & (v);
}

This is parsed as a typecast to type z of the result of taking
the address of v. Shouldn't this at least be ambiguous with an
ANDExpr ?
