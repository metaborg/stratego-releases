/** 
 * Module flattening strategy for Stratego based on the generic graph
 * flattening algorithm from the library.  The program handles
 * command-line options for indicating paths to directories with
 * library modules and finds modules based on such a path.  It writes
 * dependencies for inclusion in a Makefile to the .r.dep file.
 * Pack-stratego calls an external process (parse-mod) for parsing
 * individual modules.
