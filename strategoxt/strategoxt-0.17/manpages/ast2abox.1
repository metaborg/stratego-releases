.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBast2abox\fR
utility is used to pretty\-print abstract syntax trees. The utility transforms an abstract syntax tree according to formatting rules contained in pretty\-print tables, supplied by the
\fB\-p\fR
option. The result of
\fBast2abox\fR
is a Box term which describes the intended format. This term can be passed to a formatter which transforms the Box term to some output format.
.PP
Consult
\fBabox2text\fR
for pretty\-printing to plain text.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBParsing Options\fR
.TP
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
Use the pretty print table in
\fIfile\fR. Required option.
.PP
\fBCommon Input/Output Options\fR
.TP
\fB\-i \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
The input term given by the file name
\fI\fIfile\fR\fR.
.sp
In the absence of the
\fB\-i\fR
option, input will be read from
\fIstdin\fR.
.TP
\fB\-o \fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR
The output will be written to the file given by the file name
\fI\fIfile\fR\fR.
.sp
In the absence of the
\fB\-o\fR
option, output will be written to
\fIstdout\fR.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR
The output will be written in the binary (BAF) ATerm format.
.sp
ATerms in the BAF format require a lot less space than ones in the TAF format, but the Java ATerm library does not currently support baf ATerms. ATerms in the baf format is the preferred format of exchange between Stratego tools.
.PP
\fBCommon Debugging Options\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-about\fR
See
\fB\-\-version\fR.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage information.
.TP
\fB\-\-keep \fR\fB\fIint\fR\fR
Keep intermediate results produced by the internal stages in the pretty\-printing process. This is only useful for debugging. A high value of
\fIint\fR
indicates increased eagerness for keeping intermediate results.
.sp
Default setting is 0, indicating that no intermediates will be kept.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
Silent execution. Same as
\fB\-\-verbose \fR\fB\fI0\fR\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose \fR\fB\fIint\fR\fR
Set verbosity level to numerical value
\fIint\fR. The higher the number, the more information about pp\-aterm's inner workings are printed.
.sp
Alternatively,
\fIint\fR
can be set to either of the following verbosity levels, given in increasing order of verbosity:
\fBemergency\fR,
\fBalert\fR,
\fBcritical\fR,
\fBerror\fR,
\fBwarning\fR,
\fBnotice\fR,
\fBinfo\fR,
\fBdebug\fR,
\fBvomit\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Displays the tool name and version.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To pretty\-print an abstract syntax tree stored in the file
\fItree.trm\fR
to text according to the pretty\-print rules in
\fIrules.pp\fR
issue the following command:
.sp
.nf
$ ast2abox \-i tree.trm \-p rules.pp | abox2text
