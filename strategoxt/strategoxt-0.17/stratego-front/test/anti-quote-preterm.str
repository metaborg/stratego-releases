/**
 * (STR-685) meta-explode does not support PreTerm anti-quotations
 *
 * If an anti-quotation is defined as a PreTerm, then
 * this example fails. The problem is that a meta-explode
 * assumes that FromTerm has a Term as an argument. Often,
 * this indeed accidentally the case, since most non-constant
 * PreTerms are also Terms. However, if constant terms
 * are anti-quoted, then compilation will fail.
 *
 * This test checks two different things:
 * - if StrategoStratego uses Term anti-quotation
 * - if StrategoStratego uses PreTerm, then meta-explode is checked
