	* tools/stratego-xt-xtc-tools.str: added xtc-sglri.
	
2004-07-04  Martin Bravenboer <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: xtc-io-wrap now has a variant that takes an
	explicit usage and about argument. These strategies are used if
	the users requests for help or information about the program. The
	changes are backwards compatible.

2003-05-27  Martin Bravenboer <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* src/xtc-register.str: added an xtc-register strategy that takes
	arguments (not from config).

	* src/xtc-register.str: load XTC repository in register.

2003-05-01  Martin Bravenboer <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* tools/stratego-xt-xtc-tools: removed xtc-parse-sdf and
	xtc-pack-sdf. xtc-parse-sdf is not used and applied the third
	variant of SDF (yes, there are in fact 3 variants in StrategoXT,
	not just 2). xtc-pack-sdf performs an implosion, which is
	incorrect, so apparently it isn't used as well.

2003-12-25  Martin Bravenboer <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: updated xtc-io and xtc-output to invoke
	xtc-write-output. xtc-write-output can also handle the stdin() as
	current file.

	* src/xtc-proc.str: added xtc-ensure-file. If the current file is
	the stdin, then it will be written to a file. This is useful for
	operations that require a filename, or if the current file will be
	read multiple times, which is not possible with the stdin.

	* Makefile.am: added autoxt.m4 to EXTRA_DIST

	* Makefile.am: added line: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I . such that
	autoreconf can find autoxt.m4

2003-12-25  Martin Bravenboer <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: using mkstemp for the creation of temporary
	files.

	Temporary files of XTC are from now created in the default
	directory for temporary files (usually /tmp).

	Please clean up your working copy because the packages are using a
	local XTC installation (pre-pkgs/install) that is not rebuild on
	changes in XTC. If you do not clean up, you might break your
	Stratego compiler installation because some problems in GPP
	applications using XTC had to be fixed.

2003-08-12  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* tools/stratego-xt-xtc-tools: don't use t flag when invoking
	sglr.

2003-08-11  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-rep.str: Save repository in binary file to speed up
	reading repository.

2003-02-05  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* tools/stratego-xt-xtc-tools.str: Added xtc-stratego-ensugar and
	xtc-pp-astratego.

2003-01-18  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-query.str: do an xtc-import when performing a query

2003-01-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* xtc-call and xtc-get incorporated in xtc as "xtc call"
	and "xtc get" subcommands.

2003-01-11  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-call.str, src/xtc-get.str: command-line tools for
	calling tools or finding files in the repository.

2003-01-07  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* tools/: directory for modules with xtc-transform calls to
	specific tools.

	* tools/stratego-xt-xtc-tools.str: easy to use xtc-transform
	strategies for tools in StrategoXT like abox2text, implode-asfix
	etc.

2003-01-05  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* test for nested calls to tools to reproduce intermediate file
	bug; so far not succesful to reproduce the bug.

2003-01-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-rep.str: deal with recursive imports, not just one
	level of import.

2003-01-02  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: read-from : Check that file exists before 
	reading term from it; otherwise fail.

2003-01-01  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: 

	- xtc-io-exit: stop in the middle of a transformation pipeline,
	copying the current file to the output file indicated with the -o
	option.

	- rename-to and copy-to do nothing if the target file is the same
	as the source file

2002-12-30  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: xtc-io --- don't use xtc-output since last
	file will be temp and removed.

2002-12-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-register.str: xtc-find-path --- find the path
	of a tool by stripping of the file name from the location

	* src/xtc-proc.str: xtc-transform -- no backtracking when
	transform-file fails.

2002-12-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: xtc-temp-files: ensure that intermediate files
	are removed even if strategy fails

2002-12-18  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: copy-to makes a copy of the current
	file (e.g., in order to keep an intermediate file). xtc-io
	also incorporates xtc-temp-files.

2002-12-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: xtc-transform-... : changed the order
	of the -i/-o arguments and the other arguments to enable
	calling Java tools.

	* src/xtc-rep.str: All repository entries should be lists.

	* src/cp-file.str: Copy input file to output file 

	* src/xtc-proc.str: xtc-io and xtc-io-transform provide
	further abstractions (thanks Martin)

2002-12-15  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-rep.str: The entries of imported repositories are
	appended to existing entries. This entails that importing
	repositories can override entries of imported repositories.

2002-12-08  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-register.str: xtc-find always complains when item not
	found.

2002-12-07  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc-proc.str: Scoped introduction and automatic removal of 
	temporary files.

2002-12-03  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/xtc.str: Strategies for calling tools that are registered in
	an XTC repository. Initializing the repository is done transparantly
	when first retrieving a tool path.
