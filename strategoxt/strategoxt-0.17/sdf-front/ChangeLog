	* parse/pack-sdf.str: fixed the support for creating a dependency
	file. Makefile.xt will instruct pack-sdf to do this, so there is
	no longer a need to specify dependencies of SDF files.
	
2004-08-04  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: improved error reporting for missing
	modules. Usually, the module is not really missing, but the name
	of this import is incorrect. Hence, it is useful to report the
	module(s) from where the 'missing' module is imported.

	Example (rather verbose because of the hierarchical SDF module names)
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	/pkg/strategoxt/current/bin/pack-sdf  -i Java-15.sdf -o Java-15.def
	pack-sdf: error: module languages/java-15/expressions/Main not found
	  imported from module languages/java-15/classes/FieldDeclarations
	    in file ./languages/java-15/classes/FieldDeclarations.sdf

	pack-sdf: error: module languages/java-15/interfaces/MethodDeclarations not found
          imported from module languages/java-15/interfaces/InterfaceDeclarations
            in file
	  ./languages/java-15/interfaces/InterfaceDeclarations.sdf
	-----------------------------------------------------------------

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: pack-sdf now reports *all* missing modules
	in a single execution.

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: fatal-error invokes "exit". Tools should
	invoke xtc-exit to remove scoped temporary files. I've replace
	some fatal-errors with printnl and xtc-exit, but not all yet.

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: pack-sdf now checks if module name in an SDF
	module file, corresponds to the filename.

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: yet another improvement of the include
	mechanism. The first search option is from now the directory of
	the input file, which is not always the current directory. So,
	pack-sdf -i syn/Foo.sdf will search for module in the syn
	directory.

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: pack-sdf -i Foo.sdf now always packs
	./Foo.sdf, not a Foo in the search path if ./Foo.sdf does not
	exist.

	* pp/Sdf2.pp: Add a pp rule for a sdf-bracket extra constructor
	i.e. "bracket-symbol".

2004-06-04  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* pp/Sdf2-pgen2.1.pp: Rename as ...
	* pp/Sdf2.pp: The one and only Sdf2 pretty print table.

2004-06-04  Valentin David  <valentin@lrde.epita.fr>

	* pp/Sdf2-pgen2.0.pp: Rename as...
	* pp/Sdf2-pgen2.1.pp: this. Add pp entries for pgen2.1 extensions.
	* pp/Makefile.am: Update. Change pp-table file name.
	* xtc/sdf-xtc-tools.str: Use pgen2.1 SDF pp-table instead of the
	pgen2.0 one.

	* parse/unpack-sdf.str: Rename mkdir because it is defined into the
	ssl too.

2004-05-30  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* syn/Makefile.am: removed the SDF syntax definition modules from
	our Subversion repository and distribution. It is now directly
	obtained from the ASF Library.
	
2004-05-28  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: pack-sdf now supports the "-Idef Foo.def"
	flag. This flag can be used to import SDF modules (.sdf) from an
	SDF syntax definition (.def). The order of mixed -I and -Idef
	arguments is respected. Pack-sdf has been cleaned up a bit as
	well. (STR-42)
	
2004-04-23  Valentin David  <valentin@lrde.epita.fr>

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: When using "-of" switch of pack-sdf, the
	output tree is false. Specially the constructor of the definition
	which is "Definition" but should be "definition".
	
2004-04-23  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* parse/sdf-desugar.str: implode aterm attributes.

	* parse/sdf-ensugar.str: explode aterm attributes.

	* xtc/*: parse-sdf modules now apply sdf-desugar and
	sdf-ensugar. This should not break existing tools. I hope.
	
2004-03-27  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* parse/unpack-sdf.str: moved from sdf-tools to sdf-front.
	- now uses the new sdf syntax definition
	- create the parents of a directory as well (mkdir -p)
	
2004-02-22   Merijn de Jonge  <mdejonge@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.am: added autoxt.m4 to EXTRA_DIST

	* Makefile.am: added line: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I . such that
	autoreconf can find autoxt.m4

2004-02-18  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* xtc/parse-sdf-module.str: now uses the new sdf syntax.

	* xtc/parse-sdf-definition.str: idem

2004-02-18  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* syn/version-2.1/*: renamed the embedding of SDF 2.1 in Stratego
	to Stratego-Sdf2-Syntax because SDF syntax definition has the same
	name and I want to use Stratego-Sdf2 for the new syntax
	definition. All .meta files have been changed.

	* syn/version-pgen-2.0: now pack-sdf has been updated we can pack
	the sdf definition in ourselves. The modules have been unpacked
	and added to SVN. Todo: pack the modules from the ASF library and
	include the ASF library in the sdf2-bundle.

	* syn/version-pgen-2.0/embeddings/stratego:embedding of the new
	SDF syntax in Stratego.
	
2004-02-18  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* parse/pack-sdf.str: moved from sdf-tools to sdf-front.

	* sig/version-2.1: moved old signatures to subdirectory for the
	old version of sdf.

	* sig/version-pgen-2.0/Sdf.str: Stratego signature voor SDF2 as it
	appears in pgen 2.0. This signature has been generated using
	sdf2rtg and rtg2sig of stratego-regular since sdf2sig cannot
	handle these syntax definitions. The signature is not generated in
	the build process because stratego-regular is not yet in
	StrategoXT.
	
2004-02-13  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* xtc/sdf-options.str: moved common sdf related command line
	options and utils from stratego-regular to sdf-front.

2004-02-13  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>
	
	* pp/Sdf2.pp: improved the pretty printing of renamings using
	those sexy A/R boxes. Result:
	
        module JavaRenamed
        imports Java
                  [ PackageImportDec     => JavaPackageImportDec
                    TypeImportDec        => JavaTypeImportDec
                    ImportDec            => JavaImportDec
                    PackageDec           => JavaPackageDec
                    CompilationUnit      => JavaCompilationUnit
                    TypeDec              => JavaTypeDec
	            ....
	
2004-02-12  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* syn/version-2.1/Module-Sdf-Syntax.sdf: missing constructor for
	the renamed import module.

	* pp/Sdf2.pp: many missing pretty print rules for renamed modules.

2004-02-12  Martin Bravenboer  <martin.bravenboer@gmail.com>

	* syn/*: added the pgen 2.0 syntax definition for SDF as the first
	step into upgrading to the most recent sdf version. sdf-front now
	contains two versions of SDF2. The old one is still called
	Sdf2-Syntax. The new one is Sdf2.
	
2003-05-27  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* syn/Renaming-Sdf-Syntax.sdf: renaming productions now have
	constructors.  Constructor names copied from the v2.4 grammar at:
	http://homepages.cwi.nl/~mdejonge/grammar-base/sdf.2.4/sdf.2.4-V.def

	* syn/Stratego-Sdf2.sdf: added quotation and anti-quotation for
	aliases and renamings.

2003-05-27  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* parse/sdf-ensugar.str and desugar.str: added (de)sugaring of
	no-attrs to attrs([]).

	* syn/Stratego-Sdf2.sdf: added variables for symbols, attributes
	and productions. Quotations for Grammar and Attributes.

2003-05-26  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Added quotation and anti-quotation of symbols to Stratego-Sdf2

	* Added initial sdf-ensugar.

	* Added initial sdf-desugar. What is sugar? What is normalization?

	* Added initial Sdf2 in Stratego syntax definition. Useful for
	generation of Sdf2 and unit-testing of sdf-tools.

2003-05-23  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@mbravenboer.org>

	* Creation of sdf-front. This is a collection of material from
	sdf-tools that hasn't yet been distributed.
