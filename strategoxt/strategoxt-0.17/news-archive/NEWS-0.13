StrategoXT 0.13 -- released January ?, 2005

---------++!! Summary of Changes

StrategoXT 0.13, which represents over 3 months of development,
features updates of the Stratego compiler, the Stratego language, and
many transformation tools. Highlights include a new language feature
for dependent dynamic rules, several bug-fixes and usability
improvements of the Stratego compiler, improved reporting of parse
errors in sglri (and the Stratego compiler), more useful error reports
in sdf2rtg, and much more!

---------++ Stratego Language

---------+++ Dependent Dynamic Rules

Dynamic rules are undefined when a new rule with the same left-hand
side is defined. For example, consider the following fragment of a
constant propagation transformation:

<verbatim>
  prop-const-assign =
    ? |[ x := e ]|
    ; if <is-value> e
      then rules( PropConst.x :  |[ x ]| -> |[ e ]| )
      else rules( PropConst.x :- |[ x ]| )
      end
</verbatim>

When encountering an assignment a new dynamic rule rewriting |[ x ]|
to |[ e ]| is defined when e is a value. If e is not a value the
dynamic rule is undefined (for x). These definitions undefine any
previous PropConst rules with |[ x ]| as left-hand side. This works
for constant propagation since e is a constant value, not affected by
subsequent assignments.

This approach is not sufficient in the case where the right-hand side
of the rule contains object variables, or where the left-hand side is
a more complex pattern (as in the case of common-subexpression
elimination) including object variables. Consistently undefining such
dynamic rules requires keeping track of the dependencies of a dynamic
rule on certain terms (e.g., object variables). This can be expressed
with 0.12 dynamic rules, but at the cost of quite some code.

To capture this recurring pattern, Stratego 0.13 introduces
*dependent* dynamic rules, which list all the terms on which a rule
depends. For example, the following fragment defines the essential
part of a copy propagation transformation:

<verbatim>
  copy-prop-assign =
    ? |[ x := y ]|
    ; where( <kill-CopyProp> x )
    ; where( <not(eq)>(x,y) )
    ; where( innermost-scope-CopyProp => z )
    ; rules( CopyProp.z : |[ x ]| -> |[ y ]| depends on [(x,x), (y,y)] )
</verbatim>

The =depends on= clause declares all dependencies of the =CopyProp= rule
and the invocation of =kill-CopyProp= undefines all previously defined
rules depending on =x=, even those with =x= in the right-hand side.

Dependent dynamic rules are a generative extension of basic dynamic rules
as described in 

   M. Bravenboer, A. van Dam, K. Olmos, and E. Visser. Program
   Transformation with Scoped Dynamic Rewrite Rules. Conditionally accepted
   for the special issue on program transformation of Fundamenta
   Informaticae, 2005.

An account of the dependent dynamic rule extension is given in

   Transformations with Rewriting Strategies and Dependent Dynamic
   Rewrite Rules. In R. Bodik, editor, 14th International Conference
   on Compiler Construction (CC'05). Springer-Verlag, April 2005.

---------++ Stratego Compiler

---------+++ Compilation of Pattern-Matching in Dynamic Rules

Pattern matching in dynamic rules is implemented by replacing
non-context (that is, rule application specific) variables in the
left-hand side of the rule by dummy terms. This dummy term used to be
the empty list, which caused some problems if the pattern already
contains empty lists. The dynamic rule dummy term is now =DR_DUMMY()=,
which solves these issues.

Note that two rules that have the same left-hand side pattern, except
for an empty list in the first and a non-context variable in the
second, now also have a different key. If you want them to have the
same key, then you can for example move the =[]= pattern to the
=where= condition of the dynamic rule.

---------+++ Redefinition of External Strategies

In program that use separate compilation, redefinition of external
strategies was not always detected in the previous release. If a
redefined strategy was only invoked from the code that was separately
compiled, then the redefinition was not noticed by the compiler. This
has now been fixed. This fix might break existing code that use
separate compilation, but it only breaks code if something was already
wrong.

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ Disable SGLR Heuristic Filters from Meta File

By default, SGLR applies some heuristic filters for removing
ambiguities in parse trees. Using these heuristic filters are
discouraged, since these disambiguations are not explicitly defined in
a syntax definition. The heuristic filters can now be disabled per
Stratego module by including the term =HeuristicFilters(Off)= in the
=.meta= file for that module. This is particularly useful if you are
using a lot of concrete object syntax or if you are implementing an
object language embedding in Stratego. Disabling the heuristic filters
makes ambiguities and non-ambiguities in this mixture of languages
less surprising. See the next subsection for an example.

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ Improved Reporting of Ambiguities

If you are using concrete object syntax in Stratego, then you might
encounter ambiguities in your Stratego program, in particular if you
disable the heuristic filters of SGLR. Ambiguities in the Stratego code
(not in the object code) caused the compiler to fail in a horrible way
during C compilation. This has now been fixed by detecting these
ambiguities and reporting them in a more user-friendly way.

For example, consider this Stratego program
<verbatim>
module foo
imports Stratego list-cons tuple-cons
strategies

  main =
    !|[ Foo ]|
</verbatim>

and its =.meta= file:
<verbatim>
Meta([
  Syntax("StrategoStratego")
, HeuristicFilters(Off())
])
</verbatim>

The generated =|[ Foo ]|= construct is highly ambiguous, which is now
reported as:
<verbatim>
martin@logistico:~/tmp/str> strc -i foo.str
compiling foo.str
error: ambiguity in the definition of main. Alternatives:
    - Op("CallNoArgs",[Op("SVar",[Str("Foo")])])
    - Op("Var",[Str("Foo")])
    - Op("ConstType",[Op("SortNoArgs",[Str("Foo")])])
</verbatim>

This list shows that =|[ Foo ]|= can be a strategy call, a term
variable, or a type. The ambiguity report uses abstract syntax for
Stratego, which might be improved to concrete syntax or a better
explanation in the future. The problem with a report in concrete
syntax is that the syntax for these case is usually identical, so it
should be combined with abstract syntax and/or syntactical types
(e.g. this fragment can be a strategy, term, or type).

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ Cons and Nil: Special Constructor Names

=Cons/2= (=Cons= with two argument terms) and =Nil/0= are reserved
constructor names in Stratego, used for the representation of
lists. The compiler handled these constructors names somewhat sloppy
in previous releases, resulting in compilation errors for programs
that use =Cons= and =Nil= constructor names with a different
arity. This has now been fixed, hence only =Cons/2= and =Nil/0= are
reserved constructor names from now.

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ Stratego Library

----------+++ Changes in Separate compilation

In the previous version of StrategoXT, the separately compiled
=liblib= library imported the SSL as well as the XTC library. The
=liblib= library has now been split into =libstrategolib= (the SSL)
and =libxtclib= (XTC). The module =liblib= is still available and
imports the libraries above. Thus, no existing Stratego programs
should be affected.

    (Eelco Visser)

---------+++ Obsolete Strategy: iowrap

The strategy =iowrap= is obsolete. Many releases ago it was replaced
by =io-wrap=, which is easier to use, thanks to the storage of
command-line option values in the global =config= table. Developers
that still use =iowrap= will now get a warning. Please update your
code, since obsolete strategies might be removed in the future.

    (Rob Vermaas)

---------+++ New Module: Logging

A small library for logging has been added to the Stratego Standard
Library (it used to be part of the =stratego-regular= package). The
=log= strategy in the =logging= module combines several features:

   * The =log= strategy does not change the current term. Thus, it is
     easy to insert anywhere in your code. Optionally, it takes a
     term argument that will be logged as well. Thus, you can easily
     log a different term then the current term.

   * The =log= strategies print to the stream specified by the
     =log-stream= entry in the =config= table, or by default to
     =stderr=. This makes logging to different files easier from
     within a Stratego program.

   * The =log= strategies take a =severity= argument, which is used to
     determine whether the message should be logged at all, based on
     the verbosity level specified on the command-line.

   * The log message will include the name of the program that
     produced the message, and the severity of the message.

    (Niels Janssen and Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ New Strategy: =call= with Optional Redirection

The SSL now includes a strategy that makes the redirections of file
descriptors from method calls much easier. This new =call= strategy
takes three term arguments, which are optional (=Some= or =None=) file
descriptors for the =stdin=, =stdout=, and =stderr= of the new
process. This strategy makes it easier to write to result of a program
invocation to some file, without knowing all the nasty low-level
functions of processes and IO.

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ Bug Fixes: Pipe module

The strategies =stdin-from-pipe= and =stdout-to-pipe= didn't work
correctly when the pipe argument was =stdin= (0) or =stdout=
(1). Since =stdin= and =stdout= were explicitly closed, the connection
with the pipe was lost. Using =dup2= instead of =dup= solves the
problem because there is no need to close file
descriptors. =write-term-to-text-pipe= uses =WriteToTextFile= but the
=outfile= argument is a stream. Replacing =WriteToTextFile= by
=fprint= solved the problem.

    (Merijn de Jonge)

---------++ StrategoXT Deployment and Build System

---------+++ Separate Package for StrategoXT Utils

Tools that are not essential to most Stratego users are now in a
separate package, =strategoxt-utils=. This package consists of the
ex-StrategoXT packages =aterm-tools=, =dot-tools=, =graph-tools=,
=stratego-util= and =stratego-tools=. Obviously, the installation of
this package is optional and most users will only need if you want to
visualize ATerms with the Dot language and Graphviz.

More concrete, the following tools are part of strategoxt-utils:
=GraphXML2dot=, =pp-dot=, =sdf-wf=, =term-to-dot=, =tohtml-sdf=,
=graph-term2GraphXML=, =GraphXML-analysis=, =pp-stratego-latex-alltt=,
=sdf-doc=, =sdf-wf=, =tohtml=, =GraphXML2dot=, =ismap2usemap=,
=sdf2sg=, =sdf-imports=, and =term-to-adot=. The Emacs mode for
Stratego is now part of StrategoXT Utils.

In future releases, more non-essential utils might be moved to the
strategoxt-utils package.

    (Rob Vermaas)

---------+++ AutoXT

All the Autoconf macros of AutoXT now use the =XT_= prefix. Using such
a prefix is adviced by the Autoconf guidelines and makes it easier to
detect errors (e.g. missing macro definitions). =USE_XT_PACKAGES= has
now been replaced by =XT_USE_XT_PACKAGES=. The old macro is still
available as an =autoupdate= alias. You can run =autoupdate= to
upgrade your =configure.ac= files. =DETECT_SVN_REVISION= is now
defined as an autoupdate alias as well (Use =XT_SVN_REVISION=).

    (Akim Demaille and Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR

The subpackages of StrategoXT now share a single directory for
auxiliary files used by autoconf, automake and libtool (such as
=ltmain.sh=, =config.guess=). The =configure.ac= files in StrategoXT
define an =AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR= to achieve this.

    (Akim Demaille and Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ StrategoXT Transformation Tools

---------+++ sglri

The program =sglri=, which combines =sglr= and =implode-asfix=, now
supports error reporting with a quote of the code from the input
source file.

For example, consider this module:
<verbatim>
module foo
strategies
  main = Foo
  Foo =
   1 -> 2
</verbatim>

The error report of sglri is now:

<verbatim>
martin@logistico:~/tmp> sglri -p Stratego.tbl -i foo.str
foo.str: character '>' unexpected at line 8, column 7
  Foo =
   1 -> 2
      ^
</verbatim>
The Stratego compiler now uses sglri, so it will report syntax errors
in this way as well.

Another new feature of =sglri= is an option to disable the heuristic
filters of =sglr= by passing =--no-heuristic-filters=. You don't have
to know all the details of heuristic filters to use this
option. Disabling heuristic filters is strongly encouraged.

    (Rob Vermaas and Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ aterm2xml and xml2aterm

The =--explicit= and =--very-explicit= mode of these ATerm and XML
interoperability tools now use the XML namespace =http://aterm.org=
for XML elements that represent ATerm structures and types, such as
=list=, =tuple=, =int=, =string=, =anno= etc. In the explicit mode,
this avoids conflicts with 'real' ATerms of the same name. The tools
use the namespace prefix 'at'.

Furthermore, all modes now preserve all ATerm annotations by
representing them as nested =anno= elements in the XML namespace
=http://aterm.org=.

The =xml2aterm= tool nog longer needs an explicity argument, since it
is no longer ambiguous whether the XML input is implicit, explicit or
very explicit.

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ pp-aterm

The =pp-aterm= tool, which is used for printing an ATerm in a more
clear and structured layout, now accepts an =--max-depth= flag. This
is useful if you are only interested in the outer structure of an
ATerm and the ATerm is very large.

    (Rob Vermaas)

---------+++ sdf2rtg

The =sdf2rtg= tool, which is used to produce RTGs (and indirectly
Stratego Signatures) from SDF syntax definitions, now reports errors
in concrete syntax and gives some hints about possible solutions of
the problem.

Example:
<verbatim>
definition
module Main
exports
  context-free start-symbols Exp
  sorts Exp IntConst
  context-free syntax
    Exp "+" Exp -> Exp
    IntConst -> Exp

  lexical syntax
    [0-9]+ -> IntConst
</verbatim>

<verbatim>
martin@logistico:~/tmp> sdf2rtg -i Foo.def
No constructor name specified in production:
   <Exp-CF> <LAYOUT?-CF> "+" <LAYOUT?-CF> <Exp-CF> -> <Exp-CF>
Resolution: please add a cons attribute to this production.
</verbatim>
