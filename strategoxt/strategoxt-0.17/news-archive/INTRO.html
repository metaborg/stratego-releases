Stratego is a modular language for the specification of fully
automatic program transformation systems based on the paradigm of
rewriting strategies. The construction of transformation systems with
Stratego is supported by the XT bundle of transformation tools. The
Stratego/XT distribution integrates Stratego and XT.
