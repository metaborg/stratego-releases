  * Moved  XML Front into StrategoXT

2002-12-21

  * xml language pack is now called xml tools. This might fit better
    in StrategoXT in the future.

  * There is now also a pp-xml tool. This tool applied xml2not-xml
    followed by pp-not-xml.

  * On request of Rob Vermaas I've added a pp-table for not-xml.
    The result will be less attractive then the result of the 
    Stratego-Box pretty printer, but it works. Layout doesn't matter
    a lot for languages like XML after all: you shouldn't read it
    too often.

  * The 'pp-not-xml' tool pretty prints an non-xml term to text. This
    is a hand-crafted pretty printer. It is written with the
    Stratego-Box approach.

  * First public release of the xml language pack! Please read the
    README for more information on the tools in the xml-lang-pack.

	* Creation of package. This is a collection of earlier work that
    hasn't been offered in packages.
