 * options.r: command-line option handling (from io.r)
 * abox.r: interface to Merijn de Jonge's Box package

 * unification.r: generic implementation of unification parameterized
   with shape of variables
 * term.r: explode-term into function name and list of arguments

 * Text is no longer to be used for pretty-printing; rather
   use Merijn de Jonge's Box package
 * Create versions of io wrappers that pass (remaining) options 
   to the strategy.
 * Also new strategies for transforming a list of options, instead
   of binding variables.
 * init gives initial elements of a list, i.e., without the last
   element
 * zip-tail gives the tail of the second list after the first list
   is exhausted.
