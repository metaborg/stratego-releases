NOTE: NOT OPERATIVE

	Annotations in ATerms can be used to add extra information to
	terms that is not reflected in the term structure. However,
	due to its implementation in the ATerm library, these
	annotations are very fragile. If a subterm of the annotated
	term is modified, the annotation disappears. This is caused by
	the association of annotations to the \emph{pointers} of
	terms. This means that if the term is modified, i.e., is
	rebuilt, the annotation is no longer associated with the tree.

	In order to capture the information in annotations it is
	necessary to represent the annotations using normal term
	constructors. This means that subsequent transformations
	should be aware of the presence of the explicit annotations.

	This module defines a transformation that captures
	annotations.

\begin{code}
module annotations
signature
  constructors
    Anno : a * List(b) -> a

strategies

  get-annotation = prim("_ST_get_annotation")
  set-annotation = prim("_ST_set_annotation")

  catch-annos(s) = rec x(CatchAnnos(s); Anno(all(x), id) <+ all(x))

rules

  CatchAnnos(keys) : 
	x -> Anno(x, annos)
	where <rzip(GetAnno)> (x, <keys>()) => annos

  GetAnno : (trm, key) -> <mkterm> (key, anno)
	    where <get-annotation> (trm, key) => anno
\end{code}
