Welcome to the Stratego mailing list <stratego@cs.uu.nl> !

You are on this list because you have shown interest in Stratego in
the past. If your interest has faded since, please send a message to
stratego-request@cs.uu.nl to unsubscribe.
  
	---------------------------------------------------------
	The Stratego mailing list is intended for the discussion 
	of the design, implementation and application of Stratego
	in particular and program transformation in general. The
	list will serve also for the announcement of new releases
	of the Stratego compiler and related software.
	---------------------------------------------------------

On January 5, 2000 version 0.4.5 was released.  As of version 0.4.4a
the distribution contains the complete source code of the Stratego
compiler. The compiler is written in Stratego itself. This makes it
possible for anyone to make extensions or improvements into the
language and the compiler.

As soon as I have decided on the license to use (probably GPL) the
distribution will become truly open source. That is, you will be able
to redistribute your own versions of the compiler. This will be the
case starting with the next release.

I plan to have as many releases as possible in the near future,
incorporating a number of improvements that are on my wish list (see
TODO list in the distribution) and others that may result from the
feedback from the various projects in progress.

The latest developments were concentrated on extending the library and
improving the documentation.

+ The library of primitives (foreign functions) has been separated
from the run-time system and integrated with the specification modules
in the library. The compiler is now easily extensible with new
primitives that can be linked in from user-defined libraries.

+ The documentation has been split into four separate documents

   - The Stratego Tutorial
   - The Stratego Reference Manual
   - The Stratego Library
   - The Stratego Compiler

I plan to do some more refactoring of the library and the
implementation before I undertake more drastic reimplementation
efforts. Also the documentation, in particular the reference manual,
needs more work.

Another shortcoming of the current distribution is the lack of small
examples and regression tests. If you happen to write some cute
examples (or not so cute ones for that matter), I would be delighted
to incorporate them in the examples directory (under construction).

One of the possible future developments might be the compilation to
other target languages than C. I have had requests for SML, Haskell
and Java embeddings. Anyone interested in working with me on such
efforts is welcome. 

If you make an embedding in another language or any other extension or
improvement of the compiler, I would be happy to merge it with my
distribution, with due credits of course.
