	* spec/match/match-to-matrix.r: Defined merging of matrices also
	if not all elements of a choice or lchoice are matrices by merging
	adjacent matrices.

	* spec/opt/congruence-laws.r: Defined TransformingCongruence law
	that defines congruence in terms of matching and building. Needs
	to be improved before incorporation in the compiler.

	* spec/back/compiler.r: Defined matching of function symbol
	for congruence with TestFunTop that uses cached AFun. Removed
	obsolete code.

	* spec/slib/spec/options.r: Added strategy iowrapNoOutput that
	does not write the result term to the output file, instead leaving
	this to the wrapped strategy. This is useful for strategies that
	produce output by means of printing.

	* spec/pp/pp-instructions.r: Defined pretty-printing of
	instructions in Stratego (was implemented in C). Now easier to
	adapt.
