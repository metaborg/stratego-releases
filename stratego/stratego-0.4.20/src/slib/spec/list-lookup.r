	Lookup: find value associated to key 

	Find first element of a list to which a strategy s applies 

	An alternative formulation of lookup is the following. The
	advantage over lookup is that it does not construct
	intermediate pairs.

\begin{code}
module list-lookup
imports list-basic
rules

  Look1 : (x, [(x, y)|_]) -> y
  Look2 : (x, [_|xs]) -> (x, xs)

  Look1'(keyeq) : (x, [y|_]) -> y where <keyeq> (x, y)

strategies

   lookup = rec x(Look1 <+ Look2 ; x)

   getfirst(s) = rec x(Hd; s <+ Tl; x)

   lookup' = {x, xs: ?(x, xs) ; <getfirst({y:<<(x, y) -> y>>})> xs}

   lookup(keyeq) = rec x((Look1'(keyeq) <+ Look2; x))
\end{code}
