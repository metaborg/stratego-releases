    <h1>Version 0.4.17</h1>

 released: August 27, 2000


<h3>
 TOOLS
</h3>

<ul>

  <li> A new directory utils/ has been added to the Stratego
  distribution, which is intended for Stratego programming
  utilities. The first utility stratego-metrics.sh computes some
  simple metrics of Stratego modules.  Currently it measures number of
  constructors, rules and strategies in each of a list of modules and
  adds these figures together. Ideas for other metrics are welcome.
  <p> 

</ul>

<h3>
 LIBRARY
</h3>

<ul>

      <li> SUnit, the Stratego Unit testing framework, has been
      extended with several new testing modes, including
      apply-and-fail and apply-and-check. <p>

      <li> In addition to the generic unification strategy there is
      now also a generic equality testing strategy that is
      parameterized with a filter indicating parts of the structure
      that should be ignored in the equality comparison. (For pure
      syntactic equality a non-linear match is of course still
      sufficient.)<p>

      <li> The strategy ugly-print in module ugly-print.r maps an
      ATerm to a Box expression such that sub-terms are indented with
      respect to their parent, for better readability. Can be used as
      a generic, dumb pretty-printer. (This should be combined with
      specific pretty-printers to provide defaults.)<p>

      <li> Several library modules provide new strategies: string
      (escape), list-zip (rest-zip), io (open, save), abox-ext
      (post-commas, hpost-sep-list changed!), list-basic
      (split-fetch).  <p>

</ul>
<h3>
 COMPILER
</h3>

<ul>

  <li> The compiler has been refactored to use the new versions of the
  generic substitution and renaming algorithms.  <p>
