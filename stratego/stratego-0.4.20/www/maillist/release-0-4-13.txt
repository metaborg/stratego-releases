 Release 0.4.13 of the Stratego compiler is now available from 

	http://www.stratego-language.org/

  SUMMARY of CHANGES

  - Cleanup of keywords
  - Real numbers supported
  - Additions to the library
  - Repair of two bugs in the compiler
  - Restructuring of the reference manual

  LANGUAGE

  * Real numbers have been added to the language.

  * The identifiers new, kids and str_gt are no longer reserved
    words. new has been defined as a primitive in the library module 
    string.r.

  LIBRARY

  * New modules conditional.r and iteration.r with many new operators.

  * Two strategies for mapping a table into a list of pairs and the other way
    around (by Otto Bagge)

  * Module substitution.r contains the definition of operator "substitute" 
    which substitutes terms for (object) variables and renames bound
    variables on the way to prevent free-variable capture. It is a
    generalization of the generic renaming operator. These generic strategies 
    are documented in the WGP2000 paper on "Language Independent
    Traversals for Program Transformation". See www.stratego-language.org.

  * Primitive append-file opens a file in append mode (by Otto Bagge)

  COMPILER

  * Repaired two bugs that caused strange behaviour:-( (1) Filenames with
    a . (e.g., ../bla.r) where cut in the wrong way (i.e., to .) (2) The
    module packer wrote files to the fixed file /tmp/aaabb, which causes
    problems with more people working on the same machine. Thanks to
    Danny van Velzen and Eelco Dolstra for discovering these bugs.

  DOCUMENTATION

  * The directory doc/tutorial/slides contains the LaTeX source of the Stratego
    tutorial on slides with an introduction about
    The slides are also available from www.stratego-language.org in PostScript.

  * The reference manual has been reorganized and contains a definition of the
    syntax of Stratego in SDF2. 

  * The xmpl/ directory is intended for examples. It now contains the 
    propositional formula transformation example.

  * The documentation is now also available in pdf. Note that due to
    some problem with unsupported specials for gpic the pictures are 
    not present in the pdf version. Anyone know how to solve this?
  
  TODO

  * There is a long list of improvements to make to the language and
    implementation has been structured. See the TODO file in the
    distributions.
