 Release 0.4.18 of the Stratego compiler is now available from 

	http://www.stratego-language.org/

 This release features several refactorings of the compiler. 

 COMPILER

 * Format checkers are used to describe and guard the interfaces
   between components.

 * A new implementation of pattern matching based on the ideas of
   Mikael Pettersson in his paper "A Term Pattern-Match Compiler
   Inspired by Finite Automat Theory". This new implementation is
   not fundamentally different, but it is much simpler and solves
   an obscure bug that went unnoticed for a long time. It is also 
   a nice example of compilation by transformation; patterns from
   different strategies that are combined with + or <+ are merged
   into a single automaton.

 * Strategy definitions are compiled to separate C functions. In 
   previous versions one function with internal labels for each
   definition were used. Surprisingly gcc has managed to compile
   these long lists of instructions until now, but it started to
   give scaling problems. This change makes gcc much less memory
   hungry.

 * Constructor symbols are cached in global variables. In previous
   versions constructor symbols were matched by string comparison.
   This is now replaced with a comparison of the AFun, an integer.
   This should reduce run-time of specifications.

 * The SDF2 definition of Stratego can be found in spec/sdf

 LIBRARY

 * The tables modules has been extended with a number of useful 
   strategies for table management that can be used for instance 
   in symbol tables.
