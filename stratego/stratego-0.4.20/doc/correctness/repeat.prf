Theorem:  rec x(s; (x <+ c)) <+ c  =   rec x(s; x <+ c)
	
Proof
	    (s; (rec x(s; x <+ c)) <+ c)

	y =       rec x(s; (x <+ c)) <+ c


	y = (s; ((rec x(s; (x <+ c)) <+ c) <+ c)) <+ c

	y = (s; (rec x(s; (x <+ c)) <+ c)) <+ (s; c) <+ c

	y = (s; rec x(s; (x <+ c))) <+ (s; c) <+ (s; c) <+ c

	y = (s; rec x(s; (x <+ c))) <+ (s; c) <+ c

	y = s; (rec x(s; (x <+ c)) <+ c) <+ c

	y = s; y <+ c

	y = rec x(s; x <+ c)
