Stratego is a language for the specification of transformation rules
and strategies for applying them. Specifications consist of a
collection of modules that define the signature of the object
language(s) of the transformation, transformation rules and
strategies. The Stratego compiler translates specifications to C code.
Together with a provided run-time system these generated programs can
be used to apply the specified transformations.

This documents gives a tutorial for Stratego. It introduces the
constructs of the language, presents common architectures for
transformation systems, outlines the library of specifications that
comes with the language, explains several example specifications and a
instructions for installation and usage of the implementation.
