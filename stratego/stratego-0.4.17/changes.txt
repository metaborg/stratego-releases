	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: Refactored the definition of
	substitution and marked all old definitions (subs etc.) as
	obsolete. Wrote an explanation of the different versions of
	the strategy. There are now two parameters for indicating
	variable shape; one for that maps a variable to whatever	
	the domain of the substitution is and another that indicates
	the shape of a variable and the actual name of the variable
	(for the purpose of renaming).

	* spec/opt/optimization.r: Repaired rule to correctly use
	|tsubs|.

	* spec/slib/spec/rename.r: Removed |boxedfigure| environment
	from documentation. (Should add more documentation.)

	* spec/front/spec-to-sdefs.r: Adapted |ExpOverlay| to new
	definition substitution.

	* spec/front/normalize-spec.r: Refactored definition of
	|vars-to-consts| and removed obsolete code.

	* spec/front/inlining.r: Changed Cons syntax to [|]. Changed
	explicit use of library strategy subs to use of ssubs.

	* spec/front/Makefile.am: Added extract and inline to CLEANFILES.

	* spec/lib/stratlib.r: Removed obsolete code for renaming and
	refactored definitions of |tsubs| and |ssubs| to use the
	|substitute| strategy.

	* spec/slib/spec/unification.r: Moved definition of |in|
	(occurrence testing) to this module from substitution.r

	* reconf: Now creates the dependency files that are included in
	Makefile.am's, but that shouldn't be included in the CVS
	repository because that would memoize wrong dependencies.
