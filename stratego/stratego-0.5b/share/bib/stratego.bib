  abstract = {Stratego is a language for the specification of program
  transformation based on rewriting strategies. The Stratego compiler is based
  on program transformation; it transforms a high-level Stratego specification
  via several intermediate representations to C. Several optimizations are
  performed on the intermediate representations. The compiler is bootstrapped,
  i.e., it is specified in Stratego itself. In this paper we give an overview
  of the Stratego compiler: architecture; issues in the compilation of
  strategies; some high-lights of the specification; and experience with using
  strategies for writing program transformations.}
