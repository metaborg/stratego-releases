<H3>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Stratego: Specifying Program Transformation Systems Concisely</H3>	<blockquote><hr>
	Program transformations can be described concisely by means of
	a combination of rewrite rules that describe basic
	transformations and rewrite strategies that describe their
	application to a program.
	<hr></blockquote><BR>
<BR>
	Program transformations are often naturally described by means
	of (term) rewrite rules. However, to achieve transformations
	of an entire program such rules need to be applied with
	care. Often a more fine grained control over their application
	is needed than is offered by standard rewriting strategies
	such as innermost or outermost normalization. <BR>
<BR>
	One solution to this problem is to encode the transformation
	strategy in the rules. However, this leads to large
	specifications in which traversal over the syntax structure of
	a program needs to be spelled out explicitly. This is not
	necessary in `pure' rewriting, since the built-in strategy
	finds out where to apply a rule. In addition this style leads
	to a loss of reusability of transformation rules. <BR>
<BR>
	Another solution is to make strategies programmable artifacts
	of a transformation system. Stratego is a language for the
	specification of transformation rules and transformation
	strategies. <BR>
<BR>
	The main features of Stratego are summarized in
	Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#Fig:features">1</A>.<BR>

<H5> Audience</H5>	This reference manual describes the Stratego language from
	first principles. That means that it is organized along the
	lines of the design of the language rather than along the
	lines of learning the language. Therefore, it is aimed at
	Stratego programmers and implementers with some experience
	with the language who want to understand the details of its
	definition.<BR>
<BR>
	The Stratego Tutorial [<A HREF="index.html#Vis99.Tutorial"><CITE>11</CITE></A>] gives a
	description of the language and its programming environment by
	means of examples and is aimed at novice users. Several
	publications exist that explore aspects of the language and
	its applications; see the bibliography.<BR>
