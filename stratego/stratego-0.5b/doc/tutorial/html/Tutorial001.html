<H3>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifying Program Transformation Systems with Stratego</H3>
	<blockquote><hr>
	Stratego is a language for the specification of program
	transformation systems based on the paradigm of rewriting
	strategies. Stratego specifications give rise to term
	transformers that read a term and output a transformed
	term. Such transformation components can easily be composed
	into transformation pipelines.

<H5> Term Transformation Systems</H5>	Stratego is a language for the specification of automatic
	program transformation systems. In the Stratego model, a
	program transformation system is a program that reads a
	program, applies a transformation to it, and, if that
	succeeds, spits out the transformed program or otherwise
	states that it failed (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#Fig:BasicArch">1</A>). Programs
	are supposed to be represented by means of abstract syntax
	trees or <EM>terms</EM>. A transformation system is thus a
	program that transforms terms to terms.<BR>
<BR>
	Transformation components can be composed into pipelines that
	interface by means of intermediate terms
	(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#Fig:CompArch">2</A>). In this fashion large program
	transformation systems can be built from small reusable
	components, provided that the components synchronize on the
	intermediate languages used.<BR>
<BR>
	
<H5> Specifying Transformations with Rewriting Strategies</H5>	Basic transformation rules can be expressed as <EM>term
	rewrite rules</EM> of the form <CODE>l -&gt; r</CODE> that transform a term
	matching <CODE>l</CODE> to an instantiation of <CODE>r</CODE>.<BR>
<BR>
	Pure rewrite rules with a standard evaluation strategy are not
	sufficient for most program transformation jobs, because more
	fine grained control over their application is needed. Usually
	such control is encoded in the rewrite rules themselves,
	leading to bad reusability of rules and a large overhead for
	expressing traversals over the abstract syntax tree.<BR>
<BR>
	Instead Stratego offers a language of user-definable
	<EM>rewriting strategies</EM> that provide control over the
	application of transformation rules. This is achieved by a
	set of operators for the expression of generic traversals over
	abstract syntax trees (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#Fig:Traversal">3</A>). The basic
	operators can be combined to achieve a wide range of traversal
	algorithms.<BR>
<BR>
	The use of strategies greatly reduces the overhead caused by
	explicitly programming term traversals. Furthermore, since
	individual transformation rules are freed from the burden of
	encoding traversals, they can be reused in other situations.
	Finally, the strategy operators turn out to be an interesting
	new programming paradigm that allow one to reach deep into
	terms without much effort.
