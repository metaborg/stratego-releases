Stratego is a language for program transformation based on the
paradigm of rewriting strategies. The language is being used in a
growing number of projects. To bring together designers and users, the

Thursday, February 8, 2001.

Topics of the day include, but are not limited to 

      <ul>
      <li> Extensions and improvements 
      <li> Implementation issues 
      <li> Programming techniques and idioms 
      <li> Applications 
      </ul>


Extended abstracts for the talks will be published in a Universiteit
Utrecht technical report.

<h3>Call for Contributions </h3>

To contribute a talk to the Users day send a title and short

<h3>Stratego Tutorial</h3>

Prior to the Users day, on Wednesday, February 7, a full day tutorial
on Stratego will be given by Eelco Visser, the designer of
Stratego. In the morning session an overview of the basic principles
of Stratego is given. In the afternoon, you can apply these principles
in the lab by writing and testing a number of simple Stratego
programs. A basic understanding of programming languages and Unix
tools is assumed for the tutorial. The level of assumed Stratego
knowledge will depend on the audience.

<p>

The tutorial can be attended by a minimun of 2 and a maximum of 10
participants.

<p>

<h3>Venue</h3>

The Tutorial and Users Day will be held at the campus of Universiteit
Utrecht in Utrecht.

<p>

<h3>Call for Participation</h3>

The Tutorial and Users Day can be attended separately. 

<p>

Participation to the tutorial and the users day is free of
charge. Lunch will be provided by the Software Technology Group at the
Department of Information and Computing Sciences. Participants of the
Tutorial will get a reader of Stratego documentation. Participants of
the Users Day will get the proceedings.

<p>

All participants are invited to join us for dinner in one of Utrecht's
restaurants at the end of the day. Exact location and time will be
