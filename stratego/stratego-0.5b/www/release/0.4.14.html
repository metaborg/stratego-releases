<h3>
 SUMMARY of CHANGES
</h3>

    In this version the language is extended with a couple of new language
   constructs and some existing constructs have been generalized and made
   more robust.

    <ul>
      <li> keyword quoting (<code>'id</code>, <code>'module</code>)
      <li> overloading of constructors
      <li> as patterns (<code>x @ t</code>)
      <li> overloading of overlays and default build terms in overlays
      (<code>_ t</code>)
      <li> distributing and threading congruences
      (<code>C^D(s1,...,sn)</code> and <code>C^T(s1,...,sn)</code>)
      <li> several new strategies in the library
      <li> translation Cons/Nil lists to ATerm lists more robust
    </ul>

<h3>
 LANGUAGE
</h3>

    <ul>

 <li> Keywords (and all other identifiers) of the language can be used by quoting
   them. For example, to use the constructors module and id in a specification
   write 'module and 'id. These correspond to module and id in ATerms.

 <p><li> Constructors can now be overloaded. For example,

<pre>
   signature
     constructors
       True   : Exp
       False  : Exp
       Var    : String -> Exp
       Assign : String * Exp -> Stat
       Skip   : Stat
       If     : Exp * Stat -> Stat
       If     : Exp * Stat * Stat -> Stat
   rules
     Eval1 : If(True,  x) -> x
     Eval2 : If(False, x) -> Skip
     Eval3 : If(True,  x, y) -> x
     Eval4 : If(False, x, y) -> y
</pre>

 <p><li> As patterns of the form x @ t can be used to deconstruct a term using
   pattern matching and at the same time bind the entire term to the variable 
   x. For example, given the rule

<pre>
       rules
         R : F(x, y @ G(A, z)) -> H(x, y, z)
</pre>
   we have that
<pre>
       <R> F(B, G(A, C)) => H(B, G(A, C), C)
</pre>

 <p><li> Recall that overlays can be used to abstract from complex term patterns.
   For example, the following overlays define a term language on top of
   AsFixTerms:

<pre>
   overlays

     DefaultLayout = " "

     BinOp(o) = 
       prod([sort("E"), layout, lit(o), layout, sort("E")], sort("E"), [])

     BinExp(x, l1, o, l2, y) = 
       appl(BinOp(o), [x, l1, lit(o), l2, y])

     Add(x, l1, l2, y) = BinExp(x, l1, "+", l2, y) 
     Mul(x, l1, l2, y) = BinExp(x, l1, "*", l2, y) 
     Var(x) = appl(prod([lex(sort("Id"))], sort("E"), []), [x])
</pre>

   This makes it possible to write rules over AsFixTerms in terms of
   these higher level pseudo constructors:

<pre>
   rules
     Dist : Mul(x, l1, l2, Add(y, l3, l4, z)) -> 
            Add(Mul(x, l1, l2, y), l3, l4, Mul(x, z))
</pre>

   Note that AsFixTerms preserve layout from the source code and that
   the rule Dist defines how to preserve layout through transformations.

   Two limitations of overlays have been resolved:

 <p><li> Overlays can be overloaded and can define default build terms. In the
   example above, we would like to further abstract and also provide
   pseudo constructors that do not care about layout:

<pre>
   overlays 
     Add(x, y) = BinExp(x, "+", y)
     Mul(x, y) = BinExp(x, "*", y)
</pre>

   So that we can write

<pre>
   rules
     Dist : Mul(x, Add(y, z)) -> Add(Mul(x, y), Mul(x, z))
</pre>

   This is now possible because overlays can be overloaded, i.e., overlays
   with the same name but different arity can be defined.

   To define BinExp/3 it is necessary to do something with the layout,
   for example:

<pre>
   overlays
     BinExp(x, o, y) =   
       appl(BinOp(o), [x, DefaultLayout, lit(o), DefaultLayout, y])
</pre>

   This requires that all layout has the form DefaultLayout (i.e., " ")
   when matching and traversing the term with a congruence. 

 <p><li> Overlays can use build default terms to indicate subterms that can be
   ignored during matching and in traversal, but need a default value
   when constructing an instance. 
<pre>
     BinExp(x, o, y) =   
       appl(BinOp(o), [x, _ DefaultLayout, lit(o), _ DefaultLayout, y])
</pre>

   The last definition uses the pattern _ DefaultLayout to indicate that
   the terms at those positions can be ignored during matching and during
   congruence traversal. That is, the overlay definition has the following
   meaning
	
<pre>
      ?BinExp(x, o, y) -> 
         ?appl(BinOp(o), [x, _, lit(o), _, y])

      !BinExp(x, o, y) -> 
         !appl(BinOp(o), [x, DefaultLayout, lit(o), DefaultLayout, y])

      BinExp(x, o, y) -> // as congruence
         appl(BinOp(o), [x, id, lit(o), id, y])
</pre>


 <p><li> Distributing congruences: for each constructor c there is a corresponding 
   distributing congruence operator c^D defined according to the following 
   scheme:

<pre>
   c^D(s1,...,sn) : Pair(c(x1,...,xn),env) -> c(y1,...,yn)
                    where <s1> Pair(x1,env) => y1;
                          ...
                          <sn> Pair(xn, envn) => yn
</pre>

   For example,

<pre>
	<If^D(id,id,id)> Pair(If(Id,Id,Id),[]) 
	              => If(Pair(Id,[]),Pair(Id,[]),Pair(Id,[]))
</pre>

 <p><li> Threading congruences: for each constructor c there is a corresponding 
   threading congruence operator c^T defined according to the following 
   scheme:

<pre>
   c^T(s1,...,sn) : Pair(c(x1,...,xn),e1) -> Pair(c(y1,...,yn), e-last)
                    where <s1> Pair(x1,e1) => Pair(y1,e2);
                    ...
                    <sn> Pair(xn, en) => Pair(yn, e-last)
</pre>

   For example, if we have

<pre>
      rules
  	add-one : Pair(Id,x) -> Pair(Id,Succ(x))
</pre>

   then

<pre>
        <If^T(add-one,add-one,add-one)> Pair(If(Id,Id,Id),Zero)
	             => Pair(If(Id,Id,Id),Succ(Succ(Succ(Zero))))
</pre>

    </ul>

<h3>
 LIBRARY
</h3>

    <ul>
 <li> tuple-zip and tuple-unzip are generalizations of zipping and
   unzipping tuples of arbitrary length.

 <p><li> copy with argument can be used to apply a strategy to each copy
   that is produced. This can be useful when generating a fresh list
   of variables: <copy(new)> (n, ())

 <p><li> error prints an error message (without exiting such as fatal-error does)

 <p><li> graph-nodes-undef is a generalization of graph-nodes that also returns
   the list of nodes that are not defined.

    </ul>

<h3>
 COMPILER
</h3>

    <ul>
 <li> ATerm lists of the form [a,b,c] are represented internally by means
   of Cons/Nil lists. The translation of Cons/Nil lists back to ATerm lists
   ([...]) is now more robust and does not cause a segmentation fault on 
   improper Cons/Nil lists. This means that if there is a bug in the
   specification that causes a list of the form Cons("a", "b") to be 
   constructed, it will just output that term and will not try to 
   translate it.

    </ul>
