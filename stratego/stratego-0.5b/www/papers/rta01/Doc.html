	Program transformation is used in many areas of software
	engineering. Examples include compilation, optimization,
	synthesis, refactoring, migration, normalization and
	improvement [<A HREF="#OSPT"><CITE>15</CITE></A>]. Rewrite rules are a natural
	formalism for expressing single program transformations.
	However, using a standard strategy for normalizing a program
	with a set of rewrite rules is not adequate for implementing
	program transformation systems. It may be necessary to apply
	a rule only in some phase of a transformation, to apply rules
	in some order, or to apply a rule only to part of a
	program. These restrictions may be necessary to avoid
	non-termination or to choose a specific path in a
	non-confluent rewrite system.<BR>
<BR>
	Stratego is a language for the specification of program
	transformation systems based on the paradigm of rewriting
	strategies. It supports the separation of strategies from
	transformation rules, thus allowing careful control over the
	application of these rules. As a result of this separation,
	transformation rules are reusable in multiple different
	transformations and generic strategies capturing patterns of
	control can be described independently of the transformation
	rules they apply. Such strategies can even be formulated
	independently of the object language by means of the generic
	term traversal capabilities of Stratego.<BR>
<BR>
	In this short paper I give a description of version 0.5 of the
	Stratego system, discussing the features of the language
	(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#Sec:Language">2</A>), the library
	(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#Sec:Library">3</A>), the compiler
	(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#Sec:Compiler">4</A>) and some of the applications that
	have been built (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#Sec:Applications">5</A>). Stratego is
	available as free software under the GNU General Public
	License from <A HREF="http://www.stratego-language.org"><TT>http://www.stratego-language.org</TT></A>.<BR>

	<A NAME="Sec:Language"></A><BR>
<BR>
	In the paradigm of program transformation with rewriting
	strategies [<A HREF="#VBT98"><CITE>14</CITE></A>] a specification of a program
	transformation consists of a signature, a set of rules and a
	strategy for applying the rules. The abstract syntax trees of
	programs are represented by means of first-order terms. A
	signature declares the constructors of such
	terms. <EM>Labeled conditional rewrite rules</EM> of the form
<CODE>L: l -&gt; r where s</CODE>, with <CODE>l</CODE> and <CODE>r</CODE> patterns,
	express basic transformations on terms. A rewriting strategy
	combines rules into a program that determines where and in
	what order the rules are applied to a term. An example
	specification is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#Fig:example">1</A>.<BR>

<DIV ALIGN=center>Figure 1: A Stratego module defining several strategies for
	transforming lambda expressions using beta reduction. Strategy
	<TT>simplify</TT> makes a bottom-up traversal over an
	expression trying beta reduction at each subexpression once,
	even under lambda abstractions. Strategy <TT>eager</TT>
	reduces the argument of a function before applying it, but
	does not reduce under abstractions. Strategy <TT>whnf</TT>
	reduces an expression to weak head-normal form, i.e., does not
	normalize under abstractions or in argument
	positions. Strategies <TT>eager</TT> and <TT>whnf</TT> use the
	congruence operator <TT>App</TT> to traverse terms of the form
	<TT>App(e1,e2)</TT>, while strategy <TT>simplify</TT> uses the
	generic traversal <TT>bottomup</TT>. The strategy
	<TT>lsubs</TT> is a strategy for substituting expressions for
	variables. It is implemented in module <TT>lambda-vars</TT>
	using a generic substitution strategy. </DIV><BR>

	<A NAME="Fig:example"></A>
	<DIV ALIGN=center><HR SIZE=2></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>	A <EM>strategy</EM> is an operation that transforms a term into
	another term or fails. Rules are basic strategies that
	perform the transformation specified by the rule or fail when
	either the subject term does not match the left-hand side or
	the condition fails. Strategies can be combined into more
	complex strategies by means of a language of strategy
	operators. These operators can be divided into operators for
	sequential programming and operators for term traversal. The
	sequential programming operators <EM>identity</EM> (<CODE>id</CODE>),
	<EM>failure</EM> (<CODE>fail</CODE>), <EM>sequential composition</EM>
	(<CODE>;</CODE>), <EM>choice</EM> (<CODE>+</CODE>), <EM>negation</EM>
	(<CODE>not</CODE>), <EM>test</EM>, and <EM>recursive closure</EM>
	(<CODE>rec x(s)</CODE>) combine strategies that apply to the root of
	a term. To achieve transformations throughout a term, a
	number of <EM>term traversal primitives</EM> are provided. For
	each constructor <CODE>C/n</CODE>, the corresponding
	<EM>congruence</EM> operator <CODE>C(s1,...,sn)</CODE> expresses the
	application of strategies to the direct sub-terms of a term
	constructed with <CODE>C</CODE>. Furthermore, a number of term
	traversal operators express <EM>generic traversal</EM> to the
	direct sub-terms of a term without reference to the constructor
	of the term. These constructs allow the generic definition of
	a wide range of traversals over terms. For example, the
	strategy <CODE>all(s)</CODE> applies <CODE>s</CODE> to each direct sub-term
	of a term. Using this operator one can define
<CODE>bottomup(s) = rec x(all(x); s)</CODE>,
	which generically defines the notion of a post-order traversal
	that visits each sub-term applying the parameter strategy
	<CODE>s</CODE> to it.<BR>
<BR>
	A number of abstraction mechanisms are supported. A
	<EM>strategy definition</EM> of the form
<CODE>f(x1,...,xn) = s</CODE>
	defines the new operator <CODE>f</CODE> with <CODE>n</CODE> parameters as
	an abstraction of the strategy <CODE>s</CODE>. An <EM>overlay</EM> of
	the form
<CODE>C(x1,...,xn) = t</CODE> 
	captures the pattern <CODE>t</CODE> in a new pseudo-constructor
	<CODE>C</CODE> [<A HREF="#Vis99"><CITE>9</CITE></A>]. Constructors and strategy operators
	can be overloaded on arity. Strategies implemented
	in a foreign language (e.g., for accessing the file system)
	can be called via the <CODE>prim</CODE> construct.<BR>
<BR>
	The distinction between rules and strategies is actually only
	idiomatic, that is, rules are abbreviations for strategies
	that are composed from the actual primitives of
	transformation: matching terms against patterns and building
	instantiations of patterns. Thus, a rule
<CODE>L: l -&gt; r where s</CODE>
	is just an abbreviation of the strategy
<CODE>L = {x1,...,xn: ?l; where(s); !r}</CODE>, 
	where the <CODE>xi</CODE> are the variables used in the rule. The
	construct
<CODE>{xs: s}</CODE> 
	delimits the scope of the variables <CODE>xs</CODE> to the strategy
	<CODE>s</CODE>. The strategy <CODE>?t</CODE> matches the subject term
	against the pattern <CODE>t</CODE> binding the variables in <CODE>t</CODE>
	to the corresponding sub-terms of the subject term. The
	strategy <CODE>!t</CODE> builds an instantiation of the term pattern
	<CODE>t</CODE> by replacing the variables in <CODE>t</CODE> by the terms
	to which they are bound. Decoupling pattern matching and term
	construction from rules and scopes, and making these
	constructs into first-class citizens, opens up a wide range of
	idioms such as contextual rules and recursive patterns
	[<A HREF="#Vis99"><CITE>9</CITE></A>]. In these idioms a pattern match is passed on to
	a local traversal strategy to match sub-terms at variable
	depth in the subject term.<BR>
<BR>
	Finally, specifications can be divided into modules that can
	import other modules. The above constructs of Stratego
	together with its module system make a powerful language that
	supports concise specification of program transformations. An
	operational semantics of System S, the core of the language,
	can be found in [<A HREF="#VB98"><CITE>13</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#VBT98"><CITE>14</CITE></A>]. A limitation of the
	current language is that only a weak type system is
	implemented. Work is in progress to find a suitable type
	system that reconciles genericity with type safety.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section The Library-->

<H2>3&nbsp;&nbsp; The Library</H2><!--SEC END -->

 <A NAME="Sec:Library"></A>	The Stratego Library [<A HREF="#Vis99.lib"><CITE>10</CITE></A>] is a collection of
	modules (<FONT FACE=symbol>»</FONT>45) with reusable rules (<FONT FACE=symbol>»</FONT>130) and
	strategies (<FONT FACE=symbol>»</FONT>300). Included in the library are
	strategies for sequential control, generic traversal, built-in
	data type manipulation (numbers and strings), standard data
	type manipulation (lists, tuples, optionals), generic language
	processing, and system interfacing (I/O, process control,
	association tables).
	
	The generic traversal strategies include one-pass traversals
	(such as topdown, bottomup, oncetd, and spinetd), fixed point
	traversal (such as reduce, innermost, and outermost), and
	traversal with environments. The generic language processing
	algorithms cover free variable extraction, bound variable
	renaming, substitution, and syntactic unification
	[<A HREF="#Vis2000"><CITE>11</CITE></A>]. These algorithms are parameterized with the
	pattern of the relevant object language constructs and use the
	generic traversal capabilities of Stratego to ignore all
	constructs not relevant for the operation. For example, bound
	variable renaming is parameterized with the shape of variables
	and the binding constructs of the language.<BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section The Compiler-->

<H2>4&nbsp;&nbsp; The Compiler</H2><!--SEC END -->

 <A NAME="Sec:Compiler"></A>	The Stratego Compiler translates specifications to C code.
	The run-time system is based on the ATerm library
	[<A HREF="#BJKO2000"><CITE>4</CITE></A>], which supports the ATerm Format, a
	representation for first-order terms with prefix application
	syntax. The library implements writing and reading ATerms to
	and from the external format, which is used to exchange terms
	between tools. This enables component-based development of
	transformation tools. For example, a Stratego program can
	transform abstract syntax trees produced by any parser as long
	as it produces an ATerm representation of the abstract syntax
	tree for a program.<BR>
<BR>
	The compiler has been bootstrapped, that is, all components
	except the parser are specified in Stratego itself. The
	compiler performs various optimizations, including extracting
	the definitions that are used in the main strategy, aggressive
	inlining to enable further optimizations and merging of
	matching patterns to avoid backtracking. A limitation of the
	current compiler is that it does not support separate
	compilation and that compilation of the generated code by
	<CODE>gcc</CODE> is rather slow, resulting in long compilation times
	(e.g., 3 minutes for a large compiler component). Overcoming
	this limitation is the focus of current work.
	
<!--TOC section Applications-->

<H2>5&nbsp;&nbsp; Applications</H2><!--SEC END -->

 <A NAME="Sec:Applications"></A>	Stratego is intended for use in a wide range of language
	processing applications including source-to-source
	transformation, application generation, program optimization,
	compilation, and documentation generation. It is not intended
	for interactive program transformation or theorem proving.<BR>
<BR>
	Examples of applications that use Stratego are XT, CodeBoost,
	HSX and a Tiger compiler.
	XT is a bundle of program transformation tools [<A HREF="#JVV01"><CITE>6</CITE></A>] in
	which Stratego is included as the main language for
	implementing program transformations. The bundle comes with a
	collection of grammars for standard languages and many tools
	implemented in Stratego for generic syntax tree manipulation,
	grammar analysis and transformation, and derivation of tools
	from grammars.
	CodeBoost is a framework for the transformation of C++
	programs [<A HREF="#BHV2000"><CITE>2</CITE></A>] that is developed for domain-specific
	optimization of C++ programs for numerical applications.
	HSX is a framework for the transformation of core
	Haskell programs that has been developed for the
	implementation of the warm fusion algorithm for deforesting
	functional programs [<A HREF="#JV2000"><CITE>8</CITE></A>].
	The Tiger compiler translates Tiger programs [<A HREF="#App98"><CITE>1</CITE></A>] to
	MIPS assembly code [<A HREF="#Vis2000.tiger"><CITE>12</CITE></A>]. The compiler includes
	translation to intermediate representation, canonicalization
	of intermediate representation, instruction selection, and
	register allocation. <BR>
<BR>
<!--TOC section Related Work-->

<H2>6&nbsp;&nbsp; Related Work</H2><!--SEC END -->
	The creation of Stratego was motivated by the limitations of a
	fixed (innermost) strategy for rewriting, in particular based
	on experience with the algebraic specification formalism
	ASF+SDF [<A HREF="#DHK96"><CITE>7</CITE></A>]. The design of the strategy operators
	was inspired by the strategy language of ELAN [<A HREF="#BKKMV96"><CITE>3</CITE></A>],
	a specification language based on the paradigm of rewriting
	logic [<A HREF="#CM96"><CITE>5</CITE></A>]. For a comparison of Stratego with other
	systems see [<A HREF="#VB98"><CITE>13</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="#VBT98"><CITE>14</CITE></A>]. A survey of program
	transformation systems in general can be found in [<A HREF="#OSPT"><CITE>15</CITE></A>].
	The contributions of Stratego include: generic traversal
	primitives that allow definition of generic strategies;
	break-down of rules into primitives match and build giving
	rise to first-class pattern matching; many programming idioms
	for strategic rewriting; bootstrapped compilation of
	strategies; a foreign function interface; component-based
	programming based on exchange of ATerms.<BR>
