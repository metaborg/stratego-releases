<BR>
	In the paradigm of program transformation with rewriting
	strategies [<A HREF="Doc007.html#VBT98"><CITE>14</CITE></A>] a specification of a program
	transformation consists of a signature, a set of rules and a
	strategy for applying the rules. The abstract syntax trees of
	programs are represented by means of first-order terms. A
	signature declares the constructors of such
	terms. <EM>Labeled conditional rewrite rules</EM> of the form
<CODE>L: l -&gt; r where s</CODE>, with <CODE>l</CODE> and <CODE>r</CODE> patterns,
	express basic transformations on terms. A rewriting strategy
	combines rules into a program that determines where and in
	what order the rules are applied to a term. An example
	specification is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#Fig:example">1</A>.<BR>

<DIV ALIGN=center>Figure 1: A Stratego module defining several strategies for
	transforming lambda expressions using beta reduction. Strategy
	<TT>simplify</TT> makes a bottom-up traversal over an
	expression trying beta reduction at each subexpression once,
	even under lambda abstractions. Strategy <TT>eager</TT>
	reduces the argument of a function before applying it, but
	does not reduce under abstractions. Strategy <TT>whnf</TT>
	reduces an expression to weak head-normal form, i.e., does not
	normalize under abstractions or in argument
	positions. Strategies <TT>eager</TT> and <TT>whnf</TT> use the
	congruence operator <TT>App</TT> to traverse terms of the form
	<TT>App(e1,e2)</TT>, while strategy <TT>simplify</TT> uses the
	generic traversal <TT>bottomup</TT>. The strategy
	<TT>lsubs</TT> is a strategy for substituting expressions for
	variables. It is implemented in module <TT>lambda-vars</TT>
	using a generic substitution strategy. </DIV><BR>

	<A NAME="Fig:example"></A>
	<DIV ALIGN=center><HR SIZE=2></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>	A <EM>strategy</EM> is an operation that transforms a term into
	another term or fails. Rules are basic strategies that
	perform the transformation specified by the rule or fail when
	either the subject term does not match the left-hand side or
	the condition fails. Strategies can be combined into more
	complex strategies by means of a language of strategy
	operators. These operators can be divided into operators for
	sequential programming and operators for term traversal. The
	sequential programming operators <EM>identity</EM> (<CODE>id</CODE>),
	<EM>failure</EM> (<CODE>fail</CODE>), <EM>sequential composition</EM>
	(<CODE>;</CODE>), <EM>choice</EM> (<CODE>+</CODE>), <EM>negation</EM>
	(<CODE>not</CODE>), <EM>test</EM>, and <EM>recursive closure</EM>
	(<CODE>rec x(s)</CODE>) combine strategies that apply to the root of
	a term. To achieve transformations throughout a term, a
	number of <EM>term traversal primitives</EM> are provided. For
	each constructor <CODE>C/n</CODE>, the corresponding
	<EM>congruence</EM> operator <CODE>C(s1,...,sn)</CODE> expresses the
	application of strategies to the direct sub-terms of a term
	constructed with <CODE>C</CODE>. Furthermore, a number of term
	traversal operators express <EM>generic traversal</EM> to the
	direct sub-terms of a term without reference to the constructor
	of the term. These constructs allow the generic definition of
	a wide range of traversals over terms. For example, the
	strategy <CODE>all(s)</CODE> applies <CODE>s</CODE> to each direct sub-term
	of a term. Using this operator one can define
<CODE>bottomup(s) = rec x(all(x); s)</CODE>,
	which generically defines the notion of a post-order traversal
	that visits each sub-term applying the parameter strategy
	<CODE>s</CODE> to it.<BR>
<BR>
	A number of abstraction mechanisms are supported. A
	<EM>strategy definition</EM> of the form
<CODE>f(x1,...,xn) = s</CODE>
	defines the new operator <CODE>f</CODE> with <CODE>n</CODE> parameters as
	an abstraction of the strategy <CODE>s</CODE>. An <EM>overlay</EM> of
	the form
<CODE>C(x1,...,xn) = t</CODE> 
	captures the pattern <CODE>t</CODE> in a new pseudo-constructor
	<CODE>C</CODE> [<A HREF="Doc007.html#Vis99"><CITE>9</CITE></A>]. Constructors and strategy operators
	can be overloaded on arity. Strategies implemented
	in a foreign language (e.g., for accessing the file system)
	can be called via the <CODE>prim</CODE> construct.<BR>
<BR>
	The distinction between rules and strategies is actually only
	idiomatic, that is, rules are abbreviations for strategies
	that are composed from the actual primitives of
	transformation: matching terms against patterns and building
	instantiations of patterns. Thus, a rule
<CODE>L: l -&gt; r where s</CODE>
	is just an abbreviation of the strategy
<CODE>L = {x1,...,xn: ?l; where(s); !r}</CODE>, 
	where the <CODE>xi</CODE> are the variables used in the rule. The
	construct
<CODE>{xs: s}</CODE> 
	delimits the scope of the variables <CODE>xs</CODE> to the strategy
	<CODE>s</CODE>. The strategy <CODE>?t</CODE> matches the subject term
	against the pattern <CODE>t</CODE> binding the variables in <CODE>t</CODE>
	to the corresponding sub-terms of the subject term. The
	strategy <CODE>!t</CODE> builds an instantiation of the term pattern
	<CODE>t</CODE> by replacing the variables in <CODE>t</CODE> by the terms
	to which they are bound. Decoupling pattern matching and term
	construction from rules and scopes, and making these
	constructs into first-class citizens, opens up a wide range of
	idioms such as contextual rules and recursive patterns
	[<A HREF="Doc007.html#Vis99"><CITE>9</CITE></A>]. In these idioms a pattern match is passed on to
	a local traversal strategy to match sub-terms at variable
	depth in the subject term.<BR>
<BR>
	Finally, specifications can be divided into modules that can
	import other modules. The above constructs of Stratego
	together with its module system make a powerful language that
	supports concise specification of program transformations. An
	operational semantics of System S, the core of the language,
	can be found in [<A HREF="Doc007.html#VB98"><CITE>13</CITE></A><CITE>, </CITE><A HREF="Doc007.html#VBT98"><CITE>14</CITE></A>]. A limitation of the
	current language is that only a weak type system is
	implemented. Work is in progress to find a suitable type
	system that reconciles genericity with type safety.<BR>
