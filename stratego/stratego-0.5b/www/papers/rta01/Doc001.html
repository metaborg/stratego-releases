<H2>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</H2>	Program transformation is used in many areas of software
	engineering. Examples include compilation, optimization,
	synthesis, refactoring, migration, normalization and
	improvement [<A HREF="Doc007.html#OSPT"><CITE>15</CITE></A>]. Rewrite rules are a natural
	formalism for expressing single program transformations.
	However, using a standard strategy for normalizing a program
	with a set of rewrite rules is not adequate for implementing
	program transformation systems. It may be necessary to apply
	a rule only in some phase of a transformation, to apply rules
	in some order, or to apply a rule only to part of a
	program. These restrictions may be necessary to avoid
	non-termination or to choose a specific path in a
	non-confluent rewrite system.<BR>
<BR>
	Stratego is a language for the specification of program
	transformation systems based on the paradigm of rewriting
	strategies. It supports the separation of strategies from
	transformation rules, thus allowing careful control over the
	application of these rules. As a result of this separation,
	transformation rules are reusable in multiple different
	transformations and generic strategies capturing patterns of
	control can be described independently of the transformation
	rules they apply. Such strategies can even be formulated
	independently of the object language by means of the generic
	term traversal capabilities of Stratego.<BR>
<BR>
	In this short paper I give a description of version 0.5 of the
	Stratego system, discussing the features of the language
	(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="Doc002.html#Sec:Language">2</A>), the library
	(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="Doc003.html#Sec:Library">3</A>), the compiler
	(Section&nbsp;<A HREF="Doc004.html#Sec:Compiler">4</A>) and some of the applications that
	have been built (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="Doc005.html#Sec:Applications">5</A>). Stratego is
	available as free software under the GNU General Public
