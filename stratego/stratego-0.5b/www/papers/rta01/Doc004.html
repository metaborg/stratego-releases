<H2>4&nbsp;&nbsp; The Compiler</H2>
 <A NAME="Sec:Compiler"></A>	The Stratego Compiler translates specifications to C code.
	The run-time system is based on the ATerm library
	[<A HREF="Doc007.html#BJKO2000"><CITE>4</CITE></A>], which supports the ATerm Format, a
	representation for first-order terms with prefix application
	syntax. The library implements writing and reading ATerms to
	and from the external format, which is used to exchange terms
	between tools. This enables component-based development of
	transformation tools. For example, a Stratego program can
	transform abstract syntax trees produced by any parser as long
	as it produces an ATerm representation of the abstract syntax
	tree for a program.<BR>
<BR>
	The compiler has been bootstrapped, that is, all components
	except the parser are specified in Stratego itself. The
	compiler performs various optimizations, including extracting
	the definitions that are used in the main strategy, aggressive
	inlining to enable further optimizations and merging of
	matching patterns to avoid backtracking. A limitation of the
	current compiler is that it does not support separate
	compilation and that compilation of the generated code by
	<CODE>gcc</CODE> is rather slow, resulting in long compilation times
	(e.g., 3 minutes for a large compiler component). Overcoming
	this limitation is the focus of current work.
