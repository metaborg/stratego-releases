<b>Towards Typeful Stratego</b><p>

by Ralf Laemmel (CWI, VU)
<p>

Stratego and the underlying system S are as yet untyped. We propose a
type system which covers the essence of system S. In addition to
system S, a generic traversal primitive for folding the children of a
term is considered. This primitive is essential for type-changing
traversal strategies. The type system w hich we propose is based on
certain signature-independent generic types. We also have to introduce
a few constructs which enable us to rephrase untyped Stratego programs
in a typeful manner. The type system we propose is based on certain
signature-independent generic types.

<b>Functional Stratego</b><p>

by Eelco Dolstra (Universiteit Utrecht)
<p>

Stratego is a domain-specific language intended for the construction
of program transformation systems.  To that end, the language has a
number of interesting features; notably, first class pattern matching
and generic traversal mechanisms.  The question arises whether and how
such features can be implemented in functional programming languages
and Haskell in particular.  In a rewrite system it is essential that
one can easily recover from pattern match failure, so that alternative
rewrite rules can be tried.  Typical functional languages do not
support this very well since local pattern match failure leads to
global divergence.  This article shows how to solve this problem by
adding a choice operator to a simple functional language.  It seems
that this approach is not only useful to strategic programming, but is
also more powerful than previous proposals to extend Haskell's pattern
matching, such as views, patterns guards, and transformational
patterns.  Furthermore, we discuss how the generic programming
techniques can be employed to implement generic traversals.

<b>Ready, Steady, Stratego. Running Stratego Specifications with
StrategoScript</b><p>

by Eelco Visser (Universiteit Utrecht)

<p>

A key problem in the development of Stratego specifications has been
the slow turn around time of the Stratego compiler. To alleviate this
problem StrategoScript provides instanteneous execution of
specification through an interpreter. In this talk I present
StrategoScript by means of a couple of examples and discusses its
implementation in Stratego.

<b>XT capita selecta</b><p>

by Merijn de Jonge and Joost Visser (CWI)
<p>

XT is a bundle of program-transformation tools. Stratego is part of
this bundle, and is used as implementation language for many tools
throughout its packages.<p>  Giving special attention to the role of
Stratego, we discuss a selection of our XT experiences. These range
from the construction of meta-tools to support Stratego programming,
through Stratego techniques applied in constructing some of XT's
constituents, to projects where XT (including Stratego and tools
programmed in Stratego) has been applied to program-transformation
problems.

<b>SDL Documentation Generation</b><p>

by Ronald van Halen (Lucent Technologies)

<p>

Part of the operation of Lucent Technologies 5ESS telephone exchange
is described using an SDL dialect (Specification and Description
Language).  SDL describes the behaviour using statemachines. This
description can be a textual or a graphical one, but Lucent only uses
the textual description.  Commercial tools are not available to
interpret these SDL models, because a proprietary dialect (AT&T SDL)
is used.  By using Stratego and the XT toolset, a tool has been
created that transforms the textual SDL code into a graphical
representation of a statemachine.  Stratego was used to collect the
statenames and transitions from the textual description.  The XT tool
set and a graph drawing program were used to visualize the
statemachine. The resulting graph shows the transitions between the
states.  This makes it easier to understand the behaviour of the code,
because a graphical representation of the code is given, which
abstracts from the details contained in the textual format.

<b>CobolX: Transformations for Improving COBOL Programs</b><p>

by Hedzer Westra (Universiteit Utrecht)

<p>

There is a huge amount of legacy COBOL-code still being used today,
e.g. at bank computer systems.  Manual maintenance of this code is too
expensive. Therefore, it is desirable to automate all kinds of routine
modifications.  An important requirement in such modifications is the
preservation of comments and the original layout of the program.
CobolX is an environment for implementing transformations on COBOL
programs.  The environment is built using the Transformation Tools
(XT) package, which provides tools for parsing (SDF/SGLR),
transformation (Stratego) and pretty printing (GPP).  Since COBOL is a
complex language, it is necessary to generate all kinds of tools from
the syntax definition, since hand coding would not be feasible. The XT
package provides grammar tools for generating signatures and
pretty-print tables from syntax definitions. These tools were adapted
to support layout preservation.  As a first case study, the picture
scaling transformation has been implemented. Picture scaling involves
propagating information about the affected variables and then scaling
picture declarations and constants.
