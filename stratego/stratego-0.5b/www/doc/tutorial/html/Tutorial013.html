<H3>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp; Combining Rules into Transformation Systems with Strategies</H3>
	<blockquote><hr>
	Applying all transformation rules until none applies anymore,
	is often not a good strategy in program transformation because
	the transformation might not terminate or because many
	different transformation paths are possible, one of which
	needs to be chosen. Programmable strategies provide a way
	to control the application of transformation rules.
	<hr></blockquote>
	
	Standard term rewriting apply rules using a default strategy
	in which all rules are applied as long as possible. Therefore,
	for a rewrite system to be meaningful it should be terminating
	and confluent, i.e., whatever transformation path is chosen
	the same term results. <BR>
<BR>
	In general, however, given a collection of meaningful
	transformation rules many possible transformations on a term
	are possible. Depending on the desired outcome, different
	rules should be applied.<BR>
<BR>
	For example, the rules for transformation of propositional
	formulae can be used to transform formulae to a wide variety
	of normal forms. Formulae in <EM>disjunctive normal form</EM>
	are disjunctions of conjunctions of atoms or negations of
	atoms. Furthermore, disjunctive normal forms do not contain
	implications, equivalences or truth values. A formula in
	<EM>conjunctive normal form</EM> is a conjunction of
	disjunctions of atoms or negations of atoms. Finally, any
	propositional formula can be expressed using just implication
	and <CODE>False</CODE>.<BR>
<BR>
	Each of these normal forms can be achieved by combining a
	different selection of the rules from module
	<CODE>prop-laws</CODE> into a transformation.<BR>
<BR>
	
<H5> Transformation Strategies</H5>	Stratego supports user-definable strategies for the
	application of transformation rules. A strategy is a program
	that specifies which rules to apply in what order to which
	sub-terms of a term. <BR>
<BR>
	Rule labels are basic strategies. Strategies are composed from
	rule labels with a number of strategy operators. For example,
	the specification in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#Fig:prop-simplify.r">21</A> uses
	non-deterministic choice (<CODE>+</CODE>), sequential composition
	(<CODE>;</CODE>), and recursive closure (<CODE>rec x(s)</CODE>). 
	Application of transformations below the root of a
	term is achieved by means of traversal operators such as
	<CODE>all(s)</CODE>, which applies the strategy <CODE>s</CODE> to all
	direct sub-terms of the term to which it is applied.<BR>
<BR>
	In module <CODE>prop-simplify</CODE> the rules from modules
	<CODE>prop-laws</CODE> and <CODE>prop-truth</CODE> are combined into
	strategies that simplify formulae. Strategy <CODE>disjnf</CODE>
	transforms propositional formulae to disjunctive normal form.
	It defines a traversal over a term that pushes <CODE>Not</CODE>s
	inwards on the way down and pushes <CODE>And</CODE>s inwards on the
	way up. Strategy <CODE>conjnf</CODE> transforms formulae to
	conjunctive normal form in a similar way, but using
	<CODE>Or</CODE>-distributivity instead of <CODE>And</CODE>-distributivity.
	Strategy <CODE>desugar</CODE> defines implication and equivalence in
	terms of conjunction, disjunction, and negation.
