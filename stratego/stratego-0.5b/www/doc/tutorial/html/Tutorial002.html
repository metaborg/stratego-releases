<H3>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; When to use and not to use Stratego</H3>
	<blockquote><hr>
	Stratego is designed for the scheduling of the application of
	a series of local transformation rules on terms. Therefore,
	the language is primarily useful in source to source program
	transformation, application generation and code generation.
	It is not designed for theorem proving, program analysis,
	interactive program derivation or general purpose programming,
	although it can be used to assist in these activities.

<H5> What Stratego is for</H5>	Stratego is designed for the specification of automatic
	program transformation systems. Typical application areas of
	automatic program transformation are source-to-source
	transformations, application generation, code generation,
	program derivation and documentation generation.<BR>
<BR>
	Source-to-source transformation is the transformation of a
	program to a program in the same language. Examples of source
	to source transformations are simplification, optimization and
	desugaring, i.e., the elimination of syntactic abstractions.<BR>
<BR>
	Application generation is the translation of a program in a
	high-level (end-user) application language to an
	implementation in a general purpose programming language.<BR>
<BR>
	Code generation is the translation of program constructs to
	sequences of machine code instructions.<BR>
<BR>
	Automatic program derivation is concerned with the generation
	of programs from data. Examples of program derivations are
	the derivation of a constructor signature from a context-free
	grammar and the derivation of a pretty-printer from a
	context-free grammar [<A ><CITE>1</CITE></A>].<BR>
<BR>
	Documentation generation is the extraction of documentation
	information from a program.<BR>
<BR>
	Program analysis is concerned with deriving properties about
	elements of programs. Examples of program analysis are type
	checking, type inference, and data flow analysis. Although
	Stratego can be used to implement such analyses, it is not
	particularly well supported. This aspect should probably be
	strengthened.<BR>
<BR>
	
<H5> What Stratego is not for</H5>	Stratego is not necessarily applicable in other areas of
	program manipulation related applications. In particular, it
	is probably not the right platform for interactive program
	transformation, theorem proving and general purpose
	programming.<BR>
<BR>
	Interactive program transformation is concerned with the
	gradual transformation from a high-level specification to an
	implementation by intervention from a programmer. The
	programmer has to decide what refinement steps to apply to
	what part of the specification. However, Stratego can be used
	to make program transformation scripts that automatically
	transform a specific specification to an implementation. Such
	scripts can be written incrementally to reflect the increased
	understanding of the refinement.<BR>
<BR>
	Theorem proving is used for establishing correctness of
	programs. Stratego does not support theorem proving.
	However, it can be used to generate proof obligations as input
	for theorem provers.<BR>
<BR>
	Stratego is not a general purpose programming language to use
	for application programming, user-interface implementation,
	etc. However, it can very well be used to generate or
	transform programs in a general purpose language.
