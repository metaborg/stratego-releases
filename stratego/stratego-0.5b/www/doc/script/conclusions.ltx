%\section{Concluding Remarks}

  \paragraph{Known Limitations}

	\begin{itemize}

	\item Overlays and signatures in scripts not supported

	\item Nullary constructors in scripts should be explicitly
	made into constructors using parentheses, e.g. use Zero(), not
	Zero

	\item Only one module at a time can be imported

	\item Imports are not cached; if you import a module that was
	already imported before it will be completely imported again

	\item There may be constructs that are not supported yet

	\end{itemize}

	Immediate future work will consist in overcoming the
	limitations above. An additional possibilities is to compile
	scripts.
