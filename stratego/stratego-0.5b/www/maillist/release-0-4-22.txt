Release 0.4.22 of the Stratego compiler is now available from 

	http://www.stratego-language.org

COMPILER 

 * A new experimental optimization component has been added to the
   compiler. The commandline option --fusion of sc invokes the new
   component, which optimizes the innermost strategy. It works fine for
   invocations of innermost with a choice of rules. More coordination
   with the inliner is needed to get it to work for all cases. The
   optimization is joint work with Patty Johann. A paper about it is in
   preparation.

   If you are using innermost in any of your specifications let me know
   how the optimization behaves.

 * The implementation of the inliner has been refactored in preparation
   of better coordination with other optimizations and is now much
   simpler. The functionality is still the same.

LIBRARY 

 * list-set.r: Renamed foldr-kids to crush, following the paper by
   Joost and Ralf.
