 Release 0.4.17 of the Stratego compiler is now available from 

	http://www.stratego-language.org/

 TOOLS

 * A new directory utils/ has been added to the Stratego distribution,
   which is intended for Stratego programming utilities. The first utility
   stratego-metrics.sh computes some simple metrics of Stratego modules.
   Currently it measures number of constructors, rules and strategies in
   each of a list of modules and adds these figures together. Ideas for
   other metrics are welcome.

 LIBRARY

 * SUnit, the Stratego Unit testing framework, has been extended with 
   several new testing modes, including apply-and-fail and
   apply-and-check.

 * In addition to the generic unification strategy there is now also
   a generic equality testing strategy that is parameterized with
   a filter indicating parts of the structure that should be ignored
   in the equality comparison. (For pure syntactic equality a non-linear
   match is of course still sufficient.)

 * The strategy ugly-print in module ugly-print.r maps an ATerm to a
   Box expression such that sub-terms are indented with respect to
   their parent, for better readability. Can be used as a generic,
   dumb pretty-printer. (This should be combined with specific
   pretty-printers to provide defaults.)

 * Several library modules provide new strategies: string (escape),
   list-zip (rest-zip), io (open, save), abox-ext (post-commas,
   hpost-sep-list changed!), list-basic (split-fetch).

 COMPILER

 * The compiler has been refactored to use the new versions of the
   generic substitution and renaming algorithms.
