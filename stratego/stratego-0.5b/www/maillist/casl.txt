Subject: Stratego: The ATerm programming language

Since ATerms are the interchange format for CASL tooling I would like
to point you to Stratego, the ultimate ATerm programming language.

Stratego is a language for the specification of program transformation
systems based on rewriting strategies.

The Stratego compiler produces C code that transforms ATerms to ATerms.

* light weight
* powerful traversal primitives

* large library with generic strategies
* open source

* requires only the ATerm libary + standard GNU tools
* easy to install


More information on Stratego, including downloading, documentation,
papers and the address of the mailing list can be found on the web
page:

                 http://www.cs.uu.nl/~visser/stratego/

I would be happy to assist anyone with using Stratego. 

regards,
