bootstrapping/installation

  - directory in ../src
  - bootinstall
  - paths in stratego script?

syntax

  - rules in lets?

evaluation

  - Build: fail when variables not in scope or not defined (NULL)
  - traversal: some
  - App in Build (by desugaring)

preprocessing

  - imports: call pack-stratego
  - overlays
  - signatures
  - congruences

  -> refactor the compiler front-end such that the intepreter and the compiler
     can share the same preprocessing functionality

  - merge strategy and rule definitions!!!
  - deal with overloading

  - disambiguate overloading by extending operators with their arity

closures

  - local variables need to be renamed and/or values of free variables 
    in definitions need to be stored with those definitions

applications

  - teaching stratego
  - scripts for running transformation components

options

  - trace option: print intermediate results (can also be done using
    echo/debug)

testing

  - set up completeness tests

  - the ultimate test: interpret the interpreter running some simple
    script

compilation

  - compile stratego scripts; the script can be considered as the main
    strategy of a specification. (By translation to a module?)

interactive shell

  - call parser
