Stratego is a language for the specification of program transformation
systems based on the paradigm of rewriting strategies.  Programmable
rewriting strategies support the separation of transformation rules
and the strategies that apply them to programs, thus encouraging the
reuse of rules over many applications.  The Stratego library is a
collection of generic, language independent transformation rules and
strategies that abstract over common patterns in transformation
systems. 

This document documents all modules in the library.  For a tutorial on the
usage of Stratego see \cite{Vis99.tutorial}. The Stratego reference
manual \cite{Vis99.refman} explains the constructs of the
language. Other publications on Stratego can be found on the Stratego
web page:
