    <h1>Version 0.4.21</h1>
<hr>

 released: November 6, 2000


<h3>
      COMPILER
</h3>

<ul>

  <li> 	Handling of real constants in compiler was not correct because of
   erroneous use of ATmatch; replacedby ATgetType.
    <p>

  <li> 	
  Threading congruences were not defined for 0-ary constructors.
    <p>

  <li> 	
  Since version 0.4.18 building of constructor applications with more
   than 6 arguments was broken. (Thanks Otto Bagge for solving this.)
    <p>

  <li> 	
  The header files in the Stratego run-time system and the library
   that are not directly included by programs are now installed at
   $(prefix)/include/stratego in order to avoid name clashes with other
   packages. (Thanks Otto Bagge for the suggestion)
    <p>

</ul>

<h3>
 LIBRARY
</h3>

<ul>
      <li> list-misc: thread-map threads an environment through a list and
   applies a strategy to each element paired with the environment.
	<p>

      <li> pack-modules: Bugs in option handling fixed by Merijn de Jonge.
	<p>

      <li> list-basic: Strategies at_last, at_tail, at_suffix, and at_end have
   been renamed to at-last, at-tail, at-suffix and at-end. The old
   version are still available, but print a message that the strategy
   is obsolete.
	<p>
</ul>

<h3>
 UTILITIES
</h3>

<ul>
      <li>
The utilities directory utils/ in the distribution has been removed
   because it was causing problems in building the distribution. The
   utilities will possibly be distributed as a separate package.
</ul>
