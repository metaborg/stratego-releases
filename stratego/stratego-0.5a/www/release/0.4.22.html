<h3>
      COMPILER
</h3>

<ul>

  <li> A new experimental optimization component has been added to the
  compiler. The commandline option <code>--fusion</code> of
  <code>sc</code> invokes the new component, which optimizes the
  innermost strategy. It works fine for invocations of innermost with
  a choice of rules. More coordination with the inliner is needed to
  get it to work for all cases. The optimization is joint work with
  Patty Johann. A paper about it is in preparation.

    <p>

	  If you are using innermost in any of your specifications let
	  me know how the optimization behaves.
	  
    <p>

  <li> The implementation of the inliner has been refactored in
  preparation of better coordination with other optimizations and is
  now much simpler. The functionality is still the same.
