 Release 0.4.21 of the Stratego compiler is now available from 

	http://www.stratego-language.org

 COMPILER

 * Handling of real constants in compiler was not correct because of
   erroneous use of ATmatch; replacedby ATgetType.

 * Threading congruences were not defined for 0-ary constructors.

 * Since version 0.4.18 building of constructor applications with more
   than 6 arguments was broken. (Thanks Otto Bagge for solving this.)

 * The header files in the Stratego run-time system and the library
   that are not directly included by programs are now installed at
   $(prefix)/include/stratego in order to avoid name clashes with other
   packages. (Thanks Otto Bagge for the suggestion)

 LIBRARY

 * list-misc: thread-map threads an environment through a list and
   applies a strategy to each element paired with the environment.

 * pack-modules: Bugs in option handling fixed by Merijn de Jonge.

 * list-basic: Strategies at_last, at_tail, at_suffix, and at_end have
   been renamed to at-last, at-tail, at-suffix and at-end. The old
   version are still available, but print a message that the strategy
   is obsolete.

 UTILITIES

 * The utilities directory utils/ in the distribution has been removed
   because it was causing problems in building the distribution. The
   utilities will possibly be distributed as a separate package.
