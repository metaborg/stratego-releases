 Hi,

 Release 0.4.10 of the Stratego compiler is now available from 

	http://www.cs.uu.nl/~visser/stratego/

 SUMMARY of CHANGES

 - new syntax for comments
 - commandline option for indicating main strategy
 - keyword change: operations -> constructors
 - constructors used in rules/strategies are matched against signature;
   only warnings are generated now

 LANGUAGE

 * In addition to the (* ... *) multiline comments, you can now also write
   a // comments.

 * Signatures currently use the keyword "operations" as in 

     signature
       sorts Exp
       operations
         Var : String -> Exp

   Since operations are really constructors in Stratego, the keyword has
   been changed to "constructors":

     signature
       sorts Exp
       constructors
         Var : String -> Exp

   The old syntax will still be supported for a while, but it is advised
   to change to the new syntax.

 COMPILER

 * As Joost Visser complained, the requirement to define a "main" strategy
   to indicate the strategy to apply impedes reuse of specifications. The
   commandline option -m or --main can now be used to pass the name of the 
   main strategy to compile:

	    sc --main transform-it -i transform.r

   or
	    sc -m transform-it -i transform.r

   makes "transform-it" into the main strategy. If the option is not passed 
   "main" is assumed to be the main strategy. 	

   Note that the main strategy needs to handle its own IO as usual, that is, 
   it should probably look like 

	    transform-it = stdio(transform)
   or

	    transform-it = iowrap(transform)

  * Constructors used in rules and strategies are now matched against
    the signature. Currently only a warning is generated if a constructor
    is not declared. In the future constructor declaration will be
    enforced. Therefore it is advised to act on the warnings generated
    by the compiler and declare all constructors.

    Note that only constructors that are actually used in the specification 
    need to be declared. Anonymous constructors that are only traversed 
    need not be declared.

    Note that the library has not yet been cleaned up. Therefore the
    compiler can generated quite a few warnings for which you are not
    to blame. This will be repaired as soon as possible.

 LIBRARY

 * The strategy <transform-file(s, suf)> (base, ext) reads in the term 
   from file "base.ext", applies strategy | to it and writes the result 
   to the concatenation of the strings (base, <suf>()).

 * There was a glitch in the io library module that caused the 0.4.9
   version of the compiler to leave to many files open giving problems
   on some systems. This should now have been repaired.
