    <blockquote>

    Stratego is a language for the specification of program
    transformations. It is based on the concept of rewriting
    strategies; user-definable programs that direct the application of
    rewrite rules.  Strategies are programmed using a small set of
    operators (System S) that supports sequential non-deterministic
    programming, term traversal and matching and building terms. These
    operators support concise formulation of generic term traversals
    and pattern matching transformations. Stratego is a layer of
    syntactic abstractions on top of System S.


    <P>

    A Stratego specification consists of number of modules containing
    signatures (for definition of abstract syntax), transformation
    rules and strategy definitions. A specification can be compiled to
    an executable program using the Stratego compiler <I>sc</I>.
