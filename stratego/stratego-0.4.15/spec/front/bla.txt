	* spec/front/use-def.r: Added spec-use-defIO to make standalone
	tool.

	* spec/front/check-constructors.r: Added CheckConstructorsIO to
	make standalone tool.

	* spec/front/inlining.r: Added inlineIO strategy to make
	the inliner standalone.

	* spec/front/frontend.r: Split the frontend into the proper
	frontend that normalizes a specification and checks several
	properties, the extractor that extracts needed definitions and the
	inliner that inlines definitions. This was necessary because
	frontend.c took to long to compile (using to much memory) on my
	new Mandrake installing.

	* spec/front/extract.r: Part of the frontend concerned with
	extracting needed definitions and translating definitions into
	core language.
