	\begin{abstract}

	The strategy 'graph-nodes' is a generic
 	algorithm for mapping a graph to a collection of nodes reachable
 	from a given root node. The algorithm is parameterized with the
 	following notions: 'get-node' maps a node name and a graph to the
 	node itself, 'out-edges' maps a node to the names of its out
 	edges, 'add-node' that adds a name and its corresponding node to a
 	collection of nodes.

	Basic idea: configuration of the form \verb|(todo, done, files)|

	keep adding files corresponding to the names in \verb|todo| until
	empty

	\verb|<worklist(get, next, add)> (root, source, target)| 
	produces a target to which all things reachable from \verb|root|
	via the \verb|next| relation are \verb|add|ed. The things
	are obtained via \verb|<get>(name,source)|.
