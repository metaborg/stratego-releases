Hi,

Release 0.4.7 of the Stratego compiler has just been uploaded to the
server. The following is new:

LIBRARY

   The memo operator in library module memo makes a strategy
   into a memoizing strategy that looks up the term to be transformed
   in a memo table and only computes the transformation if the
   term is not found.

EMACS SUPPORT

   Otto Bagge contributed an emacs mode for Stratego. Now you can
   edit your Stratego modules with syntax highlighting. See 
   share/emacs/stratego.el

LANGUAGE

   Overloading of strategy operators is now supported. This means
   that the same name can be used for two strategy operators with
   different arity.

   Recall that multiple definitions for an operator with the same
   arity are equal to the choice of the bodies of the definitions.

   Note that operators that are passed to an operator unapplied can
   still not be overloaded.

TESTING

   The directory stratego/test contains regression tests for the
   compiler. Contributions are welcome.

   The distribution can be downloaded as usual from the web page:
