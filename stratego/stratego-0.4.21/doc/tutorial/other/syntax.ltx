\chapter{Connecting to the Real World}
	
\subsection{Connecting Stratego to Outside Components}

	Interfacing with the real world

	building parsers

	constructing abstract syntax

	from abstract syntax to text

	building pretty-printers

\subsection{Exchanging Terms between Components}

	more on ATerms

	binary format for terms (BAF)

\subsection{Connecting Parsers to Stratego Programs}

	\paragraph{LEX/YACC}

	Parsers based on LEX/YACC can be used by instructing the
	parser to build ATerms. This can be done via the ATerm build
	operations in the ATerm library.

	\paragraph{SDF2}

	Parser generated from SDF2 definitions create parse trees
	represented in the AsFix2 format (a subtype of the ATerm
	format).

	\paragraph{Imploding Syntax Trees}
	
	The utility \verb|implode-asfix| can be used to translate
	concrete parse trees in AsFix2 to abstract syntax trees.
	
\subsection{Connecting Pretty-printers to Stratego Programs}

	\paragraph{Generic Pretty-Printing Framework}

	Merijn de Jonge developed a framework for pretty-printing
	based on the box language. The Stratego library defines a
	signature for the box language that can be used to generated
	input for box formatters.
