\section{Concluding Remarks}
	
	Stragego is a domain-specific language for expressing tree
	transformations

	maybe optimization for special cases

	The ability for low-level control 

	look and feel: no need for total functions as in functional
	programming; more plug and play feeling; do not deal/handle
	all cases, just those you want transformed

	tension between declarative / operational programming:
	strategies allow low-level control

	flexible approach to compilation

	easy to add or remove transformations

	
	currently working on improving the compiler to add more optimizations

	now

	- straightforward translation to abstract machine instructions

	- matching tree automata for sums of strategies guarded by a match
	operation

	- simple algebraic laws

	- simple tail recursion elimination

	- experiments with specialized compilation


	some ideas for future work that I am currently working on

	- fusion of traversals

	- propagation of match knowledge through other operators than
	choice
