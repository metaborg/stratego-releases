 LANGUAGE

 <dd>

  Real numbers have been added to the language.

	      <p></p>

  The identifiers new, kids and str_gt are no longer reserved
  words. new has been defined as a primitive in the library module
  string.r.

 <dd>

  New modules conditional.r and iteration.r with many new operators.

  Two strategies for mapping a table into a list of pairs and the
  other way around (by Otto Bagge)

	      <p></p>

  Module substitution.r contains the definition of operator
  "substitute" which substitutes terms for (object) variables and
  renames bound variables on the way to prevent free-variable
  capture. It is a generalization of the generic renaming
  operator. These generic strategies are documented in the WGP2000
  paper on "Language Independent Traversals for Program
  Transformation". See www.stratego-language.org.

 <dd>
  Repaired two bugs that caused strange behaviour:-( (1) Filenames
  with a . (e.g., ../bla.r) where cut in the wrong way (i.e., to .)
  (2) The module packer wrote files to the fixed file /tmp/aaabb,
  which causes problems with more people working on the same
  machine. Thanks to Danny van Velzen and Eelco Dolstra for
  discovering these bugs.

	      <p></p>
 <dt>
  DOCUMENTATION

 <dd>
  The directory doc/tutorial/slides contains the LaTeX source of the
  Stratego tutorial on slides with an introduction about The slides
  are also available from www.stratego-language.org in PostScript.

	      <p></p>

  The reference manual has been reorganized and contains a definition
  of the syntax of Stratego in SDF2.

	      <p></p>

  The xmpl/ directory is intended for examples. It now contains the
  propositional formula transformation example.

	      <p></p>

  The documentation is now also available in pdf. Note that due to
  some problem with unsupported specials for gpic the pictures are not
  present in the pdf version. Anyone know how to solve this?

 LANGUAGE

 <dd>

   Generic term construction and deconstruction is now captured in
   syntax in the form <code>f#(xs)</code>. This denotes a constructor
   application of <code>f</code> to the list of arguments
   <code>xs</code>. This can be used, for example, in the
   decomposition rule of a generic syntacticy unification algorithm
   (see module unification.r in the library):
   
<pre>
     UfDecompose : 
        ([(f#(xs), f#(ys)) | ps], sbs) -> 
        (&lt;conc&gt;(<zip(id)>(xs, ys), ps), sbs)
</pre>

   The syntax is currently implemented as follows:

<pre>
	?f#(xs)  ==  ?(f, xs) &lt;= explode-term
	!f#(xs)  ==  &lt;mkterm&gt; (f, xs)
	s1#(s2)  ==  explode-term; (s1, s2); mkterm
</pre>

  <p></p>

 <dt>
 LIBRARY

 <dd>
   Declared constructors in the library. There should be
   no more warnings.

  <p></p>

  Module <code>env-traversal.r</code> defines several traversals that propagate
   environments through a traversal.

  <p></p>

  Module <code>basic.r</code> defines many new loop constructs (while-do, for, 
   repeat-until, etc.)

  <p></p>

  Module <code>substitution.r<code>: strategy <code>subs'<code> has
  been renamed to subs.

 Use the <code>-o</code> option to name the target to compile to.

<pre>
     sc -i spec -o target
</pre>

   This is especially useful in case the -m option is used as well to
   name the executable after the strategy:

<pre>
     sc -i spec -m strat -o strat
</pre>

  <p></p>

 Use the <code>--ast</code> option to let the compiler produce the abstract syntax
   tree of the specification. This could be useful for other tools.

  <p></p>

 <dt>
 RUN-TIME SYSTEM
 <dd>
  For some obscure reason the run-time system allocated a lot of static
   memory for stacks. This has been greatly reduced.

 <dd>

   In addition to the <code>(* ... *)</code> multiline comments, you
   can now also write <code>//</code> comments.

 <p></p>

   Signatures currently use the keyword <code>operations</code> as in 

<pre>
     signature
       sorts Exp
       operations
         Var : String -> Exp
</pre>

   Since operations are really constructors in Stratego, the keyword has
   been changed to <code>constructors</code>:

<pre>
     signature
       sorts Exp
       constructors
         Var : String -> Exp
</pre>

   The old syntax will still be supported for a while, but it is advised
   to change to the new syntax.

 <p></p>

 <dt>
 COMPILER

 <dd>
  As Joost Visser complained, the requirement to define a
  <code>main</code> strategy to indicate the strategy to apply impedes
  reuse of specifications. The commandline option <code>-m</code> or
  <code>--main</code> can now be used to pass the name of the main
  strategy to compile:

<pre>
	    sc --main transform-it -i transform.r
</pre>

   or

<pre>
	    sc -m transform-it -i transform.r
</pre>

   makes <code>transform-it</code> into the main strategy. If the
   option is not passed <code>main</code> is assumed to be the main
   strategy.

 <p></p>

   Note that the main strategy needs to handle its own IO as usual, that is, 
   it should probably look like 

<pre>
	    transform-it = stdio(transform)
</pre>
   or
<pre>
	    transform-it = iowrap(transform)
</pre>

 <p></p>

    Constructors used in rules and strategies are now matched against
    the signature. Currently only a warning is generated if a constructor
    is not declared. In the future constructor declaration will be
    enforced. Therefore it is advised to act on the warnings generated
    by the compiler and declare all constructors.

 <p></p>

    Note that only constructors that are actually used in the specification 
    need to be declared. Anonymous constructors that are only traversed 
    need not be declared.

 <p></p>

    Note that the library has not yet been cleaned up. Therefore the
    compiler can generated quite a few warnings for which you are not
    to blame. This will be repaired as soon as possible.

 <p></p>

 <dt>

 LIBRARY

 <dd>

   The strategy <code>&lt;transform-file(s, suf)&gt; (base,
   ext)</code> reads in the term from file <code>"base.ext"</code>,
   applies strategy | to it and writes the result to the concatenation
   of the strings <code>(base, <suf>())</code>.

 <p></p>

   There was a glitch in the io library module that caused the 0.4.9
   version of the compiler to leave to many files open giving problems
   on some systems. This should now have been repaired.

 LANGUAGE

 <dd>
   All sections of a specification can be empty. This was not the case
   for the 'sorts' and 'operations' sections of a specification. This
   makes it easier to generate Stratego specifications.

	      <p></p>

   Introduced new syntax for 'assignments'; the strategy expression
   <code>?t <= s</code> is equivalent to <code>s; ?t</code> and to
   <code>s => t</code>. The advantage of this new syntax is that it is
   clearer than with the <code>s => t</code> syntax what the target of
   the assignment is. If <code>s</code> is a large expression the
   <code>t</code> can be difficult to spot in <code>s => t</code>.
 
	      <p></p>

   Jus as for rules, the scope of term variables used in the body of 
   a strategy definition is declared implicitly. That means that instead of 

<pre>
  	f(s) = {x, y : ?(x, y); ...; s}
</pre>

    you can now write

<pre>
         f(s) = ?(x, y); ...; s
</pre>

 <dt>
 COMPILER

 <dd>
   The front-end of the compiler that combines the imported modules
   of a specification into a single module has been specified in
   Stratego by means of the pack-stratego component.

	      <p></p>

   Changes in the interface: the name of the specification to be
   compiled can be given with or without extension. So "<code>sc -i
   bla.r</code>" is now supported. The compiler no longer generates a
   <code>%.r.dep</code> file but a <code>%.dep</code> files containing
   dependency rules for the module being compiled for inclusion in
   Makefiles.

	      <p></p>

 <dt>
 LIBRARY

 <dd>
   Packing a module entails creating a list of all modules reachable
   from some root module. This problem is defined generically and
   is parameterized with the shape of module headers and imports.

	      <p></p>

   The renaming strategy has been redefined. It is now parameterized
   with a strategy indicating in which arguments variables are bound
   and another that defines how new variables replace the renamed
   variables. The first parameter can also be used to instantiate
   the new version of the free variable extraction algorithm. See The
   Library for more details.

	      <p></p>

   Several of the traversal operators now have versions that have an
   extra parameter for passing a skip strategy. It indicates for which
   arguments recursion stops. See simple-traversal.r and list-set.r

	      <p></p>

 <dt>
 INSTALLATION

 <dd>
   Reinstalling Stratego gave some problems in 0.4.8 because the
   installed include files are read before the local include files. 
   This is problematic when aterm and stratego installation directories 
   coincide. One solution is to uninstall the stratego distribution before 
   remaking. I have also changed the order of the includes in the makefiles 
   to prevent this problem in the future.

	      <p></p>

   Succesful installation of 0.4.8 on a NetBSD machine was reported by
   Jeroen Scheerder. This brings the list of supported platforms to:
   Linux/x86, Sun/Solaris, HP-Unix, NetBSD. Please report problematic
   or successful installation on other platforms.

	      <p></p>

 <dt>
 MAKE
   
 <dd>
   The file <code>share/Stratego.Make</code> contains generic
   makerules for compiling Stratego specifications. Include it in
   Makefiles as follows

<pre>
     include $(stratego)/share/Stratego.Make
</pre>

   where <code>$(stratego)</code> points to the prefix directory declared on 
   configuration. 

	      <p></p>

 <dt>
 AUTOMAKE

 <dd>
   Makefiles generated by automake think that .r files contain Fortran
   source. This problem occurs when declaring

<pre>
     bin_PROGRAMS = spec
</pre>
 
   where <code>spec.r</code> is a Stratego module. Otto Bagge pointed
   out that the solution is to use the <code>bin_SCRIPTS</code>
   variable and include the dependency file generated by sc:

<pre>
     bin_SCRIPTS = spec
     EXTRA_DIST = spec.r
     CLEANFILES = spec *.dep
     include spec.dep
     include $(stratego)/share/Stratego.Make
</pre>

   where <code>$(stratego)</code> points to the prefix directory
   declared on configuration of the stratego distribution. This will
   install the executable created by sc on '<code>make install</code>'
   and will include spec.r in the distribution of your package on
   '<code>make dist</code>'.

	      <p></p>

   To pass inclusion flags to sc define the <code>SCFLAGS</code>
   variable, e.g.,

<pre>
     SCFLAGS = -I $(srcdir)/../lib
</pre>

 <dd>
   The syntax of lists has been extended with notation for list tails,
   i.e., <code>[x, y | z]</code>, where x and y are the first two
   elements and z is the tail. This is translated to
   <code>Cons/Nil</code> notation. <code>[x, y | z]</code> is
   equivalent to <code>Cons(x, Cons(y, z))</code>.

   This entails the following equivalences:

<pre>
  Nil <-> []
  Cons(x, xs) <-> [x | xs]
  [a, b, c] <-> [a, b, c | []] 
            <-> Cons(a, Cons(b, Cons(c, Nil)))
</pre>

   Of course, this syntax applies to terms as well as to congruences,
   that is, <code>[s1, s2 | s3]</code> is the congruence strategy that
   applies <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> to the first two
   elements of the list and <code>s3</code> to the tail.

   (Thanks to Otto Bagge for the suggestion)

   <p>

   The lexical syntax is changed such that comment can now contain *s
   and quotes in strings are handled properly. (Thanks Merijn de Jonge
   for the code)

   <p>

 <dt>
 LIBRARY

 <dd>
   The io (file input/output operations) and abox (pretty-printing
   interface) modules are now documented (see The Library). The abox
   module has been split into abox.r for the kernel interface and 
   abox-ext.r for extensions to the interface.

   The implementation of command line option handling has been improved.
   Instead of combining option parsing and handling, a separate option
   parser can be used to transform the list of command line options
   into a list of terms that can be propagated through the transformation
   process. Module parse-options.r defines a generic parser for lists
   of options of the form <code>["-i", "file", "-silent", "-o", "outfile"]</code> to
   terms of the form <code>[Input("file"), Silent(), Output("outfile")]</code>.

   Added <code>call-noisy/0</code>, which has the function of the
   original <code>call/0</code> (calling an external process) and
   replaced <code>call/0</code> by a silent version, which does not
   print out the call.

   Overloading of strategy operators is now supported. This means
