Release 0.4.8 of the Stratego compiler has just been uploaded to the
server. The following is new:

LANGUAGE
	
   The syntax of lists has been extended with notation for list tails,
   i.e., [x, y | z], where x and y are the first two elements and z is
   the tail. This is translated to Cons/Nil notation. [x, y | z] is
   equivalent to Cons(x, Cons(y, z)).

   This entails the following equivalences:

      Nil <-> []
      Cons(x, xs) <-> [x | xs]
      [a, b, c] <-> [a, b, c | []] <-> Cons(a, Cons(b, Cons(c, Nil)))

   Of course, this syntax applies to terms as well as to congruences,
   that is, [s1, s2 | s3] is the congruence strategy that applies s1 and
   s2 to the first two elements of the list and s3 to the tail.

   (Thanks to Otto Bagge for the suggestion)

   The lexical syntax is changed such that comments can now contain *s
   and quotes in strings are handled properly. (Thanks to Merijn de Jonge
   for the code)

LIBRARY

   The io (file input/output operations) and abox (pretty-printing
   interface) modules are now documented (see The Library). The abox
   module has been split into abox.r for the kernel interface and 
   abox-ext.r for extensions to the interface.

   The implementation of command line option handling has been improved.
   Instead of combining option parsing and handling, a separate option
   parser can be used to transform the list of command line options
   into a list of terms that can be propagated through the transformation
   process. Module parse-options.r defines a generic parser for lists
   of options of the form ["-i", "file", "-silent", "-o", "outfile"] to
   terms of the form [Input("file"), Silent(), Output("outfile")].

   Added call-noisy/0, which has the function of the original call/0
   (calling an external process) and replaced call/0 by a silent version,
   which does not print out the call.

DOCUMENTATION

   Added the missing files to the distribution. (Thanks Karina)

EMACS

   The indent on tab has been turned off because it didn't care enough
   about the context. This part needs to be improved.

INSTALLATION

   The www directory contains a list of working and problematic 
   configurations for installation. If you (try to) install Stratego
   on a configuration not in the list please let me know whether
   it succeeded and what the parameters of the configuration are.
